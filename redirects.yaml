# There are two types of redirects:
#
#  (1) Simple redirects, e.g., "from: /foo"
#      - These don't match subpaths, like "/foo/bar"
#      - But it will match similar URLs "/foo", "/foo/" and "/foo/index.html"
#
#  (2) Group redirects, e.g., "from: /foo/...", which will match the top-level
#      path (with the same rules as (1)) as well as any descendant paths
#
# Redirects are checked top-to-bottom. For more information on the extended
# syntax found here, see NPM `redirects-yaml`.
#
# WARNING! Redirects DO NOT take priority over static content.
# For example, if you try to redirect "/foo" but the site contains a static file
# "/foo/index.html", the static file will always win.
