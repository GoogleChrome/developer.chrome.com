      When New CSS Features Collide: Possibility and Complexity at the Intersections
    description: >-
      We finally got a proper layout system for the web, and each browser release seems to bring with
      it another new feature that promises more creative, performant, or intuitive CSS. Each new feature
      is exciting on its own, but where it gets really interesting is when we combine these things.
      In this talk Rachel Andrew will walk you through a recent history of CSS layout, demonstrating how
      thinking has evolved, and new features have become possible because of earlier decisions. You'll
      discover the possibilities, and the complexity that lies at the intersections. Leave this talk with
      a deeper understanding of how CSS layout works, the inspiration to try combining different features,
      and a little peek at what might be around the corner.
    topics:
      - CSS
      - Web UI
