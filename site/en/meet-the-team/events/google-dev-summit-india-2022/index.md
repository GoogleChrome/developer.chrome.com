    title: Modern Web Capabilities with the Progressive Web App SVGcode
    description: >-
      In this talk, I will show at the example of the open-source application SVGcode what
      the modern Web is capable of. In 2022, Web apps can be installed onto the device
      like regular platform-specific apps and blend in with the rest of your apps naturally.
      At the end of this talk, you will walk out with a buzzing head full of ideas, but
      fret not, I will leave you with enough pointers for further reading so you can
      look up the details after the talk from the comfort of your home.
