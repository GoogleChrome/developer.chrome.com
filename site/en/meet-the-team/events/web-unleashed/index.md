      Now and Next in Responsive Design
    description: >-
      The latest CSS features landing in our browsers promise a revolution for responsive design.
      With container queries, we can look at the size of a component and adapt layout accordingly,
      perhaps using subgrid to allow those components to align to an overall grid. Media features
      allow us to work out how a user is interacting with our app, and the preferences they have
      set around things like motion.

      In this talk, Rachel Andrew will take a look at what is available right now across browsers,
      and what is just around the corner. She'll also dive into plenty of information about browser
      support to help you adopt new things with confidence.
    topics:
      - CSS
      - Web UI

      The Cost Of JavaScript In 2022
    description: >-
      As the world builds sites that are more heavily reliant on JavaScript, we sometimes pay
      for what we send down in ways that we can’t always easily see. Addy Osmani will explain
      how and why JavaScript is the most expensive resource your site uses today—especially on
      mobile and lower-end desktops.

      Addy will also share tips for fixing JavaScript performance issues so everything loads
      quicker. A little discipline can help if you want your site to load and be interactive
      as soon as possible on mobile.
