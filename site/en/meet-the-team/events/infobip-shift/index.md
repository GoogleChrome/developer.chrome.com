      Chrome Aurora
    description: >-
      A small team of Google Chrome engineers are working full-time to improve both the user
      and developer experiences of JavaScript frameworks. But why is Google trying to improve
      open-source frameworks in the first place? In this talk, we'll cover how the Chrome
      Aurora team is working to advance the web framework ecosystem by collaborating with
      Next.js, Nuxt, and Angular. From improving core loading performance to providing an
      extensive number of utilities, the optimizations the Aurora team have landed have
      already improved the developer and end-user experience of hundreds of thousands of
      applications.
    topics:
      - Performance
      - Project Aurora
