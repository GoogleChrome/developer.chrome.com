    title: Modern Web Debugging
    description: >-
      Developers today can use many abstractions and languages to build their Web
      applications. But most of the time, you likely want to debug your own code as
      you wrote it. Chrome DevTools has taken steps towards enabling you to debug Web
      applications from the authoring perspective: in terms of the original source
      language and project structure, with information that is familiar and relevant.
    topics:
      - Chrome DevTools
      - Testing
      - Debugging

      will walk us through the concept of new responsive, CSS user preferences
      media features and how we can test them with DevTools.
