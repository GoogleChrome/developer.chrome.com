    title: Bringing Page Transitions to the Web
    description: >-
      Native apps often feature transitions between states that both look great and help
      communicate the type of navigation to the user. Creating transitions between pages
      on the web is impossible, but even within the same page it's really hard to get right.
      The View Transitions API lets you create animated transitions between states without
      all the issues associated with keeping two DOMs alive simultaneously.

      New APIs are coming to simplify this process, building on top of CSS animations and
      the web animation API, and it works across navigations! In his talk, Jake will
      explain to you how it works.
