    title: How to run a performance audit on websites - Workshop
    description: >-
      Learn how to use common tools for measuring the performance of a website. We will cover:
      - PageSpeed Insights
      - WebPageTest
      - Chrome User Experience Report (CrUX)
      We will analyse real websites, to identify opportunities to make the website load faster. These audits will lead to interesting discussions on how browsers load web pages and what developers can do to give the best experience to users. Attendees are encouraged to bring along websites to audit (either ones they work on, or competitors!).
