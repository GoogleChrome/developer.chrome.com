    title: Lightning Talk on INP
    description: >-
      Interaction to Next Paint (INP) is a new responsiveness metric. During this
      Lightning Talk we’ll play a trivia game: “Will it Jank?" This trivia game
      will have a bunch of learning examples, with some gotchas and easter eggs,
      meant to teach concepts for INP and showcase how difficult it can be to
      guess performance without measuring first!
