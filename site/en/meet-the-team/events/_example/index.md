      When New CSS Features Collide: Possibility and Complexity at the
      Intersections
    # Optional
    description: >-
      We finally got a proper layout system for the web, and each browser
      release seems to bring with it another new feature that promises more
      creative, performant, or intuitive CSS. Each new feature is exciting on
      its own, but where it gets really interesting is when we combine these
      things.

      In this talk Rachel Andrew will walk you through a recent history
      of CSS layout, demonstrating how thinking has evolved, and new features
      have become possible because of earlier decisions. Youâ€™ll discover the
      possibilities, and the complexity that lies at the intersections. Leave
      this talk with a deeper understanding of how CSS layout works, the
      inspiration to try combining different features, and a little peek at what
      might be around the corner.
