    title: What's new in responsive design.
    description: >-
      The latest CSS features landing in our browsers promise a revolution for responsive design.
      With container queries, we can look at the size of a component and adapt layout accordingly,
      perhaps using subgrid to allow those components to align to an overall grid. Media features
      allow us to work out how a user is interacting with our app, and the preferences they have
      set around things like motion. In this talk, Rachel Andrew will take a look at what is
      available right now across browsers, and what is just around the corner. She’ll also dive
      into plenty of information about browser support to help you adopt new things with confidence.
