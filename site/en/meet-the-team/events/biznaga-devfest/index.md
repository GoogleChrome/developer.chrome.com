    title: Optimizing Interaction to Next Paint
    description: >-
      Did you know that 90% of time spent on most web pages is after page load? In this span
      of time, users are interacting with your website through a series of interactions such
      as clicks, taps, and keyboard inputs. The slower your website responds to those
      interactions, the more likely your users will have a negative user experience. At Google,
      we've invested significant time in developing metrics to assess page responsiveness.
      The first was First Input Delay (FID), which is a load responsiveness metric that
      measures the input delay of the first interaction. However, we discovered that we needed
      a new metric that samples more than just the first interaction—and more than that
      interaction's input delay. To comprehensively assess overall page responsiveness, we've
      created the Interaction to Next Paint (INP) metric. INP samples all page interactions,
      and more than the input delay. In this talk, you’ll learn how INP works, why it matters,
      how to measure it, and how to improve it.
