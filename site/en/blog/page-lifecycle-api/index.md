description: The Page Lifecycle API brings app lifecycle features common on mobile operating systems to the web. Browsers are now able to safely freeze and discard background pages to conserve resources, and developers can safely handle these interventions without affecting the user experience.

Modern browsers today will sometimes suspend pages or discard them entirely when
system resources are constrained. In the future, browsers want to do this
proactively, so they consume less power and memory. The [Page Lifecycle
API](https://wicg.github.io/page-lifecycle/spec.html), shipping in Chrome 68,
provides lifecycle hooks so your pages can safely handle these browser
interventions without affecting the user experience. Take a look at the API to
see whether you should be implementing these features in your application.

## Background

Application lifecycle is a key way that modern operating systems manage
resources. On Android, iOS, and recent Windows versions, apps can be started and
stopped at any time by the OS. This allows these platforms to streamline and
reallocate resources where they best benefit the user.

On the web, there has historically been no such lifecycle, and apps can be kept
alive indefinitely. With large numbers of web pages running, critical system
resources such as memory, CPU, battery, and network can be oversubscribed,
leading to a bad end-user experience.

While the web platform has long had events that related to lifecycle states
&mdash; like [`load`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Events/load),
[`unload`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Events/unload), and
[`visibilitychange`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Events/visibilitychange)
&mdash; these events only allow developers
to respond to user-initiated lifecycle state changes. For the web to work
reliably on low-powered devices (and be more resource conscious in general on
all platforms) browsers need a way to proactively reclaim and re-allocate system
resources.

In fact, browsers today already do [take active measures to conserve
resources](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Page_Visibility_API#Policies_in_place_to_aid_background_page_performance)
for pages in background tabs, and many browsers (especially Chrome) would like
to do a lot more of this &mdash; to lessen their overall resource footprint.

The problem is developers currently have no way to prepare for these types of
system-initiated interventions or even know that they're happening. This means
browsers need to be conservative or risk breaking web pages.

The [Page Lifecycle API](https://wicg.github.io/page-lifecycle/spec.html)
attempts to solve this problem by:

- Introducing and standardizing the concept of lifecycle states on the web.
- Defining new, system-initiated states that allow browsers to limit the
  resources that can be consumed by hidden or inactive tabs.
- Creating new APIs and events that allow web developers to respond to
  transitions to and from these new system-initiated states.

This solution provides the predictability web developers need to build
applications resilient to system interventions, and it allows browsers to more
aggressively optimize system resources, ultimately benefiting all web users.

The rest of this post will introduce the new Page Lifecycle features shipping in
Chrome 68 and explore how they relate to all the existing web platform states
and events. It will also give recommendations and best-practices for the types
of work developers should (and should not) be doing in each state.

## Overview of Page Lifecycle states and events

All Page Lifecycle states are discrete and mutually exclusive, meaning a page
can only be in one state at a time. And most changes to a page's lifecycle state
are generally observable via DOM events (see [developer recommendations for each
state](#developer-recommendations-for-each-state) for the exceptions).

Perhaps the easiest way to explain the Page Lifecycle states &mdash; as well as
the events that signal transitions between them &mdash; is with a diagram:

### States

The following table explains each state in detail. It also lists the possible
states that can come before and after as well as the events developers can
use to observe changes.

### Events

Browsers dispatch a lot of events, but only a small portion of them signal a
possible change in Page Lifecycle state. The table below outlines all events
that pertain to lifecycle and lists what states they may transition to and from.

<strong style="color:red">*</strong> Indicates a new event defined by the Page Lifecycle API

### New features added in Chrome 68

The chart above shows two states that are system-initiated rather than
user-initiated: [frozen](#state-frozen) and [discarded](#state-discarded).
As mentioned above, browsers today already occasionally freeze and discard
hidden tabs (at their discretion), but developers have no way of knowing when
this is happening.

In Chrome 68, developers can now observe when a hidden tab is frozen and
unfrozen by listening for the [`freeze`](https://wicg.github.io/page-lifecycle/spec.html#sec-api)
and [`resume`](#event-resume) events on `document`.

```js
document.addEventListener('freeze', (event) => {
  // The page is now frozen.
});

document.addEventListener('resume', (event) => {
  // The page has been unfrozen.
});
```

In Chrome 68 the `document` object also now includes a
[`wasDiscarded`](https://wicg.github.io/page-lifecycle/spec.html#sec-api)
property. To determine whether a page was discarded while in a hidden
tab, you can inspect the value of this property at page load time (note:
discarded pages must be reloaded to use again).

```js
if (document.wasDiscarded) {
  // Page was previously discarded by the browser while in a hidden tab.
}
```

For advice on what things are important to do in the `freeze` and `resume`
events, as well as how to handle and prepare for pages being discarded, see
[developer recommendations for each state](#developer-recommendations-for-each-state).

The next several sections offer an overview of how these new features fit into
the existing web platform states and events.

## Observing Page Lifecycle states in code

In the [active](#state-active), [passive](#state-passive), and [hidden](#state-hidden)
states, it's possible to run JavaScript code that determines the current
Page Lifecycle state from existing web platform APIs.

```js
const getState = () => {
  if (document.visibilityState === 'hidden') {
    return 'hidden';
  }
  if (document.hasFocus()) {
    return 'active';
  }
  return 'passive';
};
```

The [frozen](#state-frozen) and [terminated](#state-terminated) states, on the
other hand, can only be detected in their respective event listener
([`freeze`](#event-freeze) and [`pagehide`](#event-pagehide)) as the state is
changing.

### Observing state changes

Building on the `getState()` function defined above, you can observe all Page
Lifecycle state changes with the following code.

```js
// Stores the initial state using the `getState()` function (defined above).
let state = getState();

// Accepts a next state and, if there's been a state change, logs the
// change to the console. It also updates the `state` value defined above.
const logStateChange = (nextState) => {
  const prevState = state;
  if (nextState !== prevState) {
    console.log(`State change: ${prevState} >>> ${nextState}`);
    state = nextState;
  }
};

// Options used for all event listeners.
const opts = {capture: true};

// These lifecycle events can all use the same listener to observe state
// changes (they call the `getState()` function to determine the next state).
['pageshow', 'focus', 'blur', 'visibilitychange', 'resume'].forEach((type) => {
  window.addEventListener(type, () => logStateChange(getState(), opts);
});

// The next two listeners, on the other hand, can determine the next
// state from the event itself.
window.addEventListener('freeze', () => {
  // In the freeze event, the next state is always frozen.
  logStateChange('frozen');
}, opts);

window.addEventListener('pagehide', (event) => {
  // If the event's persisted property is `true` the page is about
  // to enter the back/forward cache, which is also in the frozen state.
  // If the event's persisted property is not `true` the page is
  // about to be unloaded.
  logStateChange(event.persisted ? 'frozen' : 'terminated');
}, opts);
```

The above code does three things:

- Sets the initial state using the `getState()` function.
- Defines a function that accepts a next state and, if there's a change,
  logs the state changes to the console.
- Adds
  [capturing](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener#capture)
  event listeners for all necessary lifecycle events, which in turn call
  `logStateChange()`, passing in the next state.

One thing to note about the above code is that all the event listeners are added
to `window` and they all pass
[`{capture: true}`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener#Syntax).
There are a few reasons for this:

- Not all Page Lifecycle events have the same target. `pagehide`, and
  `pageshow` are fired on `window`; `visibilitychange`, `freeze`, and
  `resume` are fired on `document`, and `focus` and `blur` are fired on their
  respective DOM elements.
- Most of these events do not bubble, which means it's impossible to add
  non-capturing event listeners to a common ancestor element and observe all
  of them.
- The capture phase executes before the target or bubble phases, so adding
  listeners there helps ensure they run before other code can cancel them.

## Developer recommendations for each state

As developers, it's important to both understand Page Lifecycle states _and_
know how to observe them in code because the type of work you should (and should
not) be doing depends largely on what state your page is in.

For example, it clearly doesn't make sense to display a transient notification
to the user if the page is in the hidden state. While this example is pretty
obvious, there are other recommendations that aren't so obvious that are worth
enumerating.

      <p>This means you should treat the <i>hidden</i> state as the likely end to the

Once again, since reliability and ordering of lifecycle events is not
consistently implemented in all browsers, the easiest way to follow the advice
in the table above is to use
[PageLifecycle.js](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/page-lifecycle).

## Legacy lifecycle APIs to avoid

### The unload event

{% Aside 'warning' %}
Never use the `unload` event on modern browsers.
{% endAside %}

Many developers treat the `unload` event as a guaranteed callback and use it as
an end-of-session signal to save state and send analytics data, but doing this
is **extremely unreliable**, especially on mobile! The `unload` event does not
fire in many typical unload situations, including closing a tab from the tab
switcher on mobile or closing the browser app from the app switcher.

For this reason, it's always better to rely on the
[`visibilitychange`](#event-visibilitychange) event to determine when a session
ends, and consider the hidden state the
[last reliable time to save app and user data](#advice-hidden).

Furthermore, the mere presence of a registered `unload` event handler (via
either `onunload` or `addEventListener()`) can prevent browsers from being able
to put pages in the [back/forward cache](#back-forward-cache) for faster
back and forward loads.

In all modern browsers, it's recommended to always use the
[`pagehide`](#event-pagehide) event to detect possible page unloads (a.k.a the
[terminated](#state-terminated) state) rather than the `unload` event. If you
need to support Internet Explorer versions 10 and lower, you should feature
detect the `pagehide` event and only use `unload` if the browser doesn't support
`pagehide`:

```js
const terminationEvent = 'onpagehide' in self ? 'pagehide' : 'unload';

window.addEventListener(terminationEvent, (event) => {
  // Note: if the browser is able to cache the page, `event.persisted`
  // is `true`, and the state is frozen rather than terminated.
});
```

### The beforeunload event

{% Aside 'caution' %}
Never add a `beforeunload` listener unconditionally or use it as an
end-of-session signal. Only add it when a user has unsaved work, and remove
it as soon as that work has been saved.
{% endAside %}

The `beforeunload` event has a similar problem to the `unload` event, in that
when present it prevents browsers from caching the page in their
[back/forward cache](#back-forward-cache).

The difference between `beforeunload` and `unload`, though, is that there are
legitimate uses of `beforeunload`. For instance, when you want to warn the user
that they have unsaved changes they'll lose if they continue unloading the page.

Since there are valid reasons to use `beforeunload` but using it prevents pages
from being added to the back/forward cache, it's recommended that you _only_
add `beforeunload` listeners when a user has unsaved changes and then remove
them immediately after the unsaved changes are saved.

In other words, don't do this (since it adds a `beforeunload` listener
unconditionally):

```js
addEventListener('beforeunload', (event) => {
  // A function that returns `true` if the page has unsaved changes.
  if (pageHasUnsavedChanges()) {
    event.preventDefault();
    return (event.returnValue = 'Are you sure you want to exit?');
  }
});
```

Instead do this (since it only adds the `beforeunload` listener when it's
needed, and removes it when it's not):

```js
const beforeUnloadListener = (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  return (event.returnValue = 'Are you sure you want to exit?');
};

// A function that invokes a callback when the page has unsaved changes.
onPageHasUnsavedChanges(() => {
  addEventListener('beforeunload', beforeUnloadListener);
});

// A function that invokes a callback when the page's unsaved changes are resolved.
onAllChangesSaved(() => {
  removeEventListener('beforeunload', beforeUnloadListener);
});
```

## FAQs

**Why isn't there a "loading" state?**

The Page Lifecycle API defines states to be discrete and mutually exclusive.
Since a page can be loaded in either the active, passive, or hidden state, and
since it can change states—or even be terminated—before it finishes loading, a
separate loading state does not make sense within this paradigm.

**My page does important work when it's hidden, how can I stop it from being frozen or discarded?**

There are lots of legitimate reasons web pages shouldn't be frozen while running
in the hidden state. The most obvious example is an app that plays music.

There are also situations where it would be risky for Chrome to discard a page,
like if it contains a form with unsubmitted user input, or if it has a
`beforeunload` handler that warns when the page is unloading.

For the moment, Chrome is going to be conservative when discarding pages and
only do so when it's confident it won't affect users. For example, pages that
have been observed to do any of the following while in the hidden state will not
be discarded unless under extreme resource constraints:

- Playing audio
- Using WebRTC
- Updating the table title or favicon
- Showing alerts
- Sending push notifications

For the current list features used to determine whether a tab can be safely
frozen or discarded, see: [Heuristics for Freezing &amp; Discarding](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QJpuBTdllLVflMJSov0tlFX3e3yfSfd_-al2IBavbQM/edit?usp=sharing)
in Chrome.

{% Aside %}
In the case of pages that update the title or favicon to alert users of unread
notifications, we currently have a
[proposal to enable
these kinds of updates from service worker](https://github.com/WICG/page-lifecycle/issues/24), which would allow Chrome to
freeze or discard the page but still show changes to the tab title or favicon.
{% endAside %}

<strong id="back-forward-cache">What is the back/forward cache?<strong>

The [back/forward cache](https://web.dev/bfcache/) is a term used to describe a
navigation optimization some browsers implement that makes using the back and
forward buttons faster.

When a user navigates away from a page, these browsers freeze a version of that
page so that it can be quickly resumed in case the user navigates back using
the back or forward buttons. Remember that adding a `beforeunload` or `unload`
event handler [prevents this optimization from being
possible](#legacy-lifecycle-apis-to-avoid).

For all intents and purposes, this freezing is functionally the same as
the freezing browsers perform to conserve CPU/battery; for that reason it's
considered part of the [frozen](#state-frozen) lifecycle state.

**If I can't run asynchronous APIs in the frozen or terminated states, how can I save data to IndexedDB?**

In frozen and terminated states,
[freezable tasks](https://wicg.github.io/page-lifecycle/spec.html#html-task-source-dfn)
in a page's [task queues](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#task-queue)
are suspended, which means asynchronous and callback-based APIs such as IndexedDB
cannot be reliably used.

In the future, we will [add a `commit()` method to
`IDBTransaction`](https://github.com/w3c/IndexedDB/pull/242) objects, which will
give developers a way to perform what are effectively write-only transactions
that don't require callbacks. In other words, if the developer is just writing
data to IndexedDB and not performing a complex transaction consisting of reads
and writes, the `commit()` method will be able to finish before task queues are
suspended (assuming the IndexedDB database is already open).

For code that needs to work today, however, developers have two options:

- **Use Session Storage:** [Session Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage)
  is synchronous and is persisted across page discards.
- **Use IndexedDB from your service worker:** a service worker can store data in
  IndexedDB after the page has been terminated or discarded. In the `freeze` or
  `pagehide` event listener you can send data to your service worker via
  [`postMessage()`](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/service-worker/post-message/),
  and the service worker can handle saving the data.

{% Aside %}
While the second option above will work, it's not ideal in situations where
the device is freezing or discarding the page due to memory pressure since
the browser may have to wake up the service worker process, which will put
more strain on the system.
{% endAside %}

## Testing your app in the frozen and discarded states

To test how your app behaves in the frozen and discarded states, you can visit
[chrome://discards](chrome://discards) to actually freeze or discard any of your
open tabs.

<figure>
  <a href="https://wd.imgix.net/image/eqprBhZUGfb8WYnumQ9ljAxRrA72/3XJWjEWVr0g36h8H1eJr.png">
    {% Img src="image/eqprBhZUGfb8WYnumQ9ljAxRrA72/3XJWjEWVr0g36h8H1eJr.png", alt="Chrome Discards UI", width="800", height="142" %}
  </a>
</figure>

This allows you to ensure your page correctly handles the `freeze` and `resume`
events as well as the `document.wasDiscarded` flag when pages are reloaded after
a discard.

## Summary

Developers who want to respect the system resources of their user's devices
should build their apps with Page Lifecycle states in mind. It's critical that
web pages are not consuming excessive system resources in situations that the
user wouldn't expect

The more developers start implementing the new Page Lifecycle APIs, the safer it
will be for browsers to freeze and discard pages that aren't being used. This
means browsers will consume less memory, CPU, battery, and network resources,
which is a win for users.
