  Speed is now a landing page factor for Google Search and Ads.
---

When **real** users have a slow experience on mobile, they're much less likely
to find what they are looking for or purchase from you in the future. For many
sites this equates to a huge missed opportunity, especially when more than half
of visits are abandoned if a mobile page takes over [3 seconds to load](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/data-gallery/detail/mobile-site-abandonment-three-second-load/).

Last week, Google Search and Ads teams announced two new speed initiatives to
help improve user-experience on the web. Both efforts recommend that site owners
and developers pay attention to
[user-centric performance metrics](https://web.dev/user-centric-performance-metrics/)
and use tools such as [Lighthouse](/docs/lighthouse/) and
[PageSpeed Insights](https://web.dev/whats-new-pagespeed-insights/), and real-world field data
(e.g. see [Chrome User Experience Report](/docs/crux/about/))
to diagnose and improve user experiences.

## Speed is now used as a ranking factor for mobile searches

Users want to find answers to their questions quickly and
[data](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/data-measurement/mobile-page-speed-new-industry-benchmarks/)
shows that people really care about how quickly their pages load. The Search
team announced speed would be a [ranking signal](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2010/04/using-site-speed-in-web-search-ranking.html)
for desktop searches in 2010 and as of this month (July 2018), page [speed will be a ranking factor for mobile searches](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2018/01/using-page-speed-in-mobile-search.html)
too.

If you're a developer working on a site, now is a good time to evaluate your
performance using our [speed tools](https://web.dev/speed-tools/). Think about how
[performance](https://web.dev/rail/) affects the user experience
of your pages and consider measuring a variety of real-world [user-centric performance metrics](https://web.dev/user-centric-performance-metrics/).

Are you shipping [too much JavaScript](https://web.dev/performance-optimizing-content-efficiency/)?
Too many images? Images and JavaScript are the [most significant contributors](https://paulcalvano.com/index.php/2018/07/02/impact-of-page-weight-on-load-time/)
to the page weight that affect page load time based on data from [HTTP Archive](https://httparchive.org/) and the [Chrome User Experience Report](/docs/crux/) - our public dataset for key
UX metrics as experienced by Chrome users under real-world conditions.

To evaluate performance, check:

- [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/), an online tool that shows
  speed [field data](https://web.dev/speed-tools/#field-data) for
  your site, alongside suggestions for common optimizations to improve it.
- [Lighthouse](/docs/lighthouse/), [a lab tool](https://web.dev/speed-tools/#lab_data) providing
  personalized advice on how to improve your website across performance,
  accessibility, PWA, SEO, and other best practices.

### The Mobile Speed Score for ads landing pages

Advertising and speed go hand in hand, with faster landing pages delivering
better ROI. Last week, at Google Marketing Live, the Ads team [introduced the new mobile speed score](https://www.blog.google/products/ads/mobile-landing-page-speed-score/).

The [1-10 mobile speed score (10 being the fastest)](https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/7450207) is based on
**real-world user experience data**, taking into account many factors including
the relationship between page speed and potential conversion rates. This score
lets you quickly see which landing pages on mobile are providing a fast
experience on mobile and which need some work.

You should also implement [Parallel tracking](https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/7650215), which will soon
(October 30th, 2018) become mandatory for all Ads accounts. This enhancement
helps load landing pages more quickly, which can reduce lost visits. Parallel
tracking sends customers directly from your ad to your final URL while click
measurement happens in the background using the browser's
[navigator.sendBeacon()](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Navigator/sendBeacon)
method.

To help discuss and prioritize speed in your organization, we've made available
tools like the [Speed Scorecard](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/feature/mobile/), allowing you to
compare mobile site-speed to your peers, and the [Impact Calculator](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/feature/mobile/), a tool for
estimating the revenue impact investing in speed could have on your mobile
site.

### Next steps: measure, optimize, monitor and repeat

Optimized web experiences lead to higher user engagement, conversions, and ROI;
performance is a feature and a competitive edge.
