Chrome 91 beta was released on April 22, 2021 and is expected to become the
stable version in late May, 2021.

## Remove alert(), confirm(), and prompt() for cross origin iframes

{% Aside 'note' %}
**Updated September, 2nd 2021**: Chrome started gradual rollout in Chrome 92 but backed out due to an unexpected amount of breakage. Chrome has rolled back the change and has postponed the deprecation until at least January 2022. Developers are still encouraged to migrate to non-system dialogs.
{% endAside %}

Chrome allows iframes to trigger Javascript dialogs. For example it shows "<URL>
says ..." when the iframe is the same origin as the top frame, and "An embedded
page on this page says..." when the iframe is cross-origin. This is confusing,
and has led to spoofs where sites pretend the message comes from Chrome or a
different website.

Chrome 91 deprecates this ability. [Removing
support](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5148698084376576) for cross origin
iframes' ability to call `alert()`, `confirm()`, and `prompt()` will prevent
this kind of spoofing, and unblock further UI simplifications. For example, this
means notexample.com will no longer be able to call `window.alert()`,
`window.prompt()`, or `window.confirm()` if embedded in an iframe on
example.com.
