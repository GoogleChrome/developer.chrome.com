Chrome DevTools makes debugging CSS grid layouts intuitive with a variety of visualization options.

Watch the video to learn how to toggle the grid overlay in the **Elements** panel and use it to:

{% Img src="image/NJdAV9UgKuN8AhoaPBquL7giZQo1/I2PqMSLelhTdl7lng4Yu.png", alt="Grid overlay.", width="800", height="424" %}

- Visualize and inspect grid layouts.
- See row and column numbers to refer to when placing grid items.
- Use line and area names and see them on the overlay if you have a lot of grid items and the numbers are confusing.
- Check track sizes.

Additionally, with the [**Grid Editor**](/docs/devtools/css/grid/#grid-editor) in the **Elements** > **Styles** pane, you can align items and their content in a grid layout with a click of a button instead of typing CSS rules.
