In the **Local Storage** and **Session Storage** panes, you can:

- View key-value pairs and filter through them.
- Double-click to edit keys and values and see the changes applied on the page after a refresh.
- Double-click the empty area to add new key-value pairs. To remove a pair, right-click it.
