"[International Mother Language Day][imld]" is an annual celebration of cultural diversity observed worldwide on February 21.  It promotes the preservation and protection of languages spoken all over the world and celebrates multilingualism. 

The web is built for everyone, no matter what language. While it is easy to believe that most of the web developer community communicates in English, there are many communities in the world where there is no English proficiency at all! While Chrome's team itself mostly communicates in English, the members of the team come from all over the world, speaking a huge number of languages.

We want to ensure that everyone feels a part of the web community. To celebrate the many languages spoken by members of the Chrome team, we'll be publishing a video each week in a different language starting February 21. If you don't speak the language, we will be providing subtitles in many languages for you to follow along.
