Some exciting libraries have cropped up lately:

[Paper.js](http://paperjs.org/) - a vector graphics scripting framework that runs on top of `<canvas>`. It is based on and largely compatible with [Scriptographer](http://scriptographer.org), a scripting environment for Adobe Illustrator. If you've ever wanted an object model to sit above canvas, take a peek.

[RPG JS](http://rpgjs.com/)- a role playing game framework for 2D games that leverages [EaselJS](http://easeljs.com/) for its scene graph. Can use many [RPG Maker XP](http://www.rpgmakerweb.com/product/rpg-maker-xp) assets to get a quick head start.

[Chop Slider](http://www.idangero.us/cs/) - making heavy use of CSS transitions and effects to get impressive transitions between states.
