Today, we published [Maximize ad relevance without third-party
cookies](/docs/privacy-sandbox/maximize-ad-relevance). If you are a product
leader, CTO, CMO, or CEO, you'll gain insights into how you can use the Privacy
Sandbox APIs and other new optimizations to deliver personalized advertising,
while still providing a privacy-preserving experience. 

We know it's critical that the ad industry can continue to successfully reach
customers after third-party cookie deprecation, while also providing strong
privacy for Chrome browser users. The Privacy Sandbox APIs can be part of the
solution, alongside automated targeting techniques powered by machine
learning models.
