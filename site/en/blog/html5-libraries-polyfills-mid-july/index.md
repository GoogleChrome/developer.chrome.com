More awesome libraries popping up all over the place:

- [SmokeJS](https://ssssnakes.com/smoke/) - A framework-agnostic styled alert system for JavaScript.
- [Buzz](http://buzz.jaysalvat.com) - Buzz is a small but powerful JavaScript library that allows you to easily take advantage of the new HTML5 audio element. It degrades gracefully on non-modern browsers.
- [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js) - polyfill for the FileSaver's `window.saveAs()` API. Save blobs/files, client-side.
- [BlobBuilder.js](https://github.com/eligrey/BlobBuilder.js) - BlobBuilder API polyfill.
- [canvas-toBlob.js](https://github.com/eligrey/canvas-toBlob.js) - Polyfill for HTML5 canvas's `toBlob()` method, which is not implemented by any browsers.
