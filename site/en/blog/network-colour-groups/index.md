Get a simple overview of resource types in the Network panel with the __Color-code resource types__ feature. To enable (if not already)


1. Go to Settings (the cog wheel)
1. In the general section, find the network heading.
1. Check __Color-code resource types__.


Each of Scripts, Stylesheets, documents, fonts and more will be colored based on its type so you can easily understand what you're looking at without having to read the filename.
