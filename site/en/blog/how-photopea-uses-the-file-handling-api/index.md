## Introduction

(This article is also available in form of a video.)

[Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) is a free online image editor developed by [Ivan Kutskir](https://blog.ivank.net/). Ivan started working on the app in 2012, and maintains a [blog](https://blog.photopea.com/) sharing the major features he adds to Photopea. Photopea can work with PSD (Adobe Photoshop), XCF (GIMP), Sketch (Sketch App), XD (Adobe XD), and CDR (CorelDRAW) formats.

## File handling in Photopea

As an [installable PWA](https://web.dev/articles/install-criteria), Photopea runs in a standalone window when the user chooses to install the app. Doing so unlocks a PWA super power, which Photopea makes heavy use of: [file handling](/articles/file-handling/).

### The declarative part of the File Handling API

After installation, Photopea registers itself as a file handler with the operating system for the different file formats it supports. This happens in the [Web App Manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/Manifest), by adding the [`file_handlers`](/articles/file-handling/#the-declarative-part-of-the-file-handling-api) field. Each supported file type is an object, the [`action`](/articles/file-handling/#the-declarative-part-of-the-file-handling-api:~:text=An-,%22action%22,-property%20that%20points) has a relative URL as its value, the [`accept`](/articles/file-handling/#the-declarative-part-of-the-file-handling-api:~:text=An-,%22accept%22,-property%20with%20an) object a map of MIME types and associated file extensions. For example, `{"image/jpeg": [".jpeg", ".jpg"]}`. The following code is the production [Web App Manifest of Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/manifest.json), with the relevant parts highlighted.

### The imperative part of the File Handling API

The imperative part of the API then deals with actually handling the file(s) that the operating system passes to the PWA. Photopea's [code](https://www.photopea.com/code/pp/pp.js) is obviously heavily minimized and uglified, but nevertheless the gist of the snippet below is not so hard to grasp. The [`LaunchQueue`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/LaunchQueue) interface (minified as `N`) has a [`setConsumer()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/LaunchQueue/setConsumer) method, which accepts a function as an argument. This function in turn takes a [`LaunchParams`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/LaunchParams) object (minified as `W`) . This `LaunchParams` object has a [`files`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/LaunchParams/files) property pointing at a read-only array of [`FileSystemHandle`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/FileSystemHandle) objects, which the rest of the code then loops over and for each obtains the [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/File) object (minified as `G`) by calling [`getFile()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/FileSystemFileHandle/getFile). This file is then passed off to other logic in Photopea that takes care of displaying the file.

```js
var N = window.launchQueue;
if (N) {
  var $ = this.UA;
  N.setConsumer(function (W) {
    var O = W.files;
    console.log(O);
    for (var Y = 0; Y < O.length; Y++) {
      var T = O[Y];
      T.getFile().then(function (G) {
        $.YO([G], null, null, null, [T]);
      });
    }
  });
}
```

## Conclusions

[Users have been asking](https://www.reddit.com/r/photopea/comments/nwokkt/making_photopea_the_default_image_editor/) for [Photopea to become a file handler for images](https://github.com/photopea/photopea/issues/1901) for a long time. In 2020, when the question appeared, this feature was completely unthinkable, but an [eager user discovered the file handling API](https://github.com/photopea/photopea/issues/1901#issuecomment-1010608610) in its earliest stages in the beginning of 2022 when it was still behind a flag. File handling eventually [shipped in Chrome 102](https://fugu-tracker.web.app/#file-handling) and has been a beloved Photopea feature used on a daily basis by its users, some even [calling it a gamechanger](https://github.com/photopea/photopea/issues/1901#issuecomment-1011285025). Be sure to [give Photopea a try](https://www.photopea.com/), install it on your desktop, and then try opening one of the file formats it supports! Happy image editing!
