## Preview feature: New Recorder panel {: #recorder }

Use the new **Recorder** panel to record, replay and measure user flows. 

[Open the **Recorder** panel](/docs/devtools/recorder/#open). Follow the instructions on screen to start a new recording. 

For example, you can record the coffee checkout process with this [coffee ordering demo](https://coffee-cart.netlify.app/) application. After adding a coffee and filling out payment details, you can end the recording, replay the process or click on the **Measure performance** button to measure the user flow in the **Performance** panel.

Go to the **Recorder** panel [documentation](/docs/devtools/recorder/) to learn more with the step-by-step tutorial!

The **Recorder** panel is a preview feature. Our team is still actively working on it and we are looking for your [feedback](https://goo.gle/recorder-feedback) for further enhancements.

## Refresh device list in Device Mode {: #device }

## Autocomplete with Edit as HTML {: #code-completion }

The **Edit as HTML** UI now supports autocomplete and syntax highlights. In the **Elements** panel, right click on an element, and select  **Edit as HTML**. Try typing a DOM property (e.g. `id`, `aria`), the autocomplete should help you find the property name you're looking for.

## Improved code debugging experience {: #debugging }

Column numbers are now included in the output error in the Console. Having easy access to the column number is essential for debugging especially with minified JavaScript.

## [Experimental] Syncing DevTools settings across devices {: #sync }

Your DevTools settings are now synced across devices by default when you turn on Chrome profile sync. You can change the DevTools sync settings via **Settings** > **Sync** > **Enable settings sync**.

This new setting makes it easier for you to work across devices. For example, the following appearance settings are synced so you have a consistent experience across devices and donâ€™t need to re-define the same settings again. Learn more about the sync feature in [DevTools customization](/docs/devtools/customize/).

This feature is experimental at the moment, the team is still actively working on it. If you have any feedback, please share with us [here](https://crbug.com/1245541).
