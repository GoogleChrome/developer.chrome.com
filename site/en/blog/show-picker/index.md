For a long time, you had to resort to custom widget libraries or hacks to show a
date picker. The web platform now ships with the HTMLInputElement `showPicker()` method,
a canonical way to show a browser picker not only for dates, but also time,
color, and files.

## Background {: #background }

A [frequent request] we hear from web developers is:

<blockquote>
  <p>
    How do I programmatically<br/>
    show a picker for controls like date?
  </p>
  <cite>
    Stack Overflow
  </cite>
</blockquote>

Current answers are not great; they rely on external libraries, CSS hacks, or
specific browser behaviors like simulating a user interaction with `click()`.

I'm happy to share that those days will be over soon as the web platform is
introducing a canonical way to show a browser picker for `<input>` elements with
these types: `"date"`, `"month"`, `"week"`, `"time"`, `"datetime-local"`,
`"color"`, and `"file"`. It will also work for `<input>` elements with
suggestions powered by `<datalist>` or `"autocomplete"` which we'll cover as
well in this article.

{% Aside %}
Unlike a third-party picker widget, a browser picker is familiar to the user,
has great platform-specific support, and is always maintained as part of the
browser.

## How to show a picker {: #how-to }

Calling `showPicker()` on an `<input>` element shows a browser picker to the
user. It must be called in response to a user gesture such as a touch gesture or
mouse click; otherwise it will fail with a [`NotAllowedError`][error] exception.
For security reasons, it will throw a [`SecurityError`][error] exception when
it's called in a cross-origin iframe.

A browser picker is shown when the `<input>` element is one of these types:
`"date"`, `"month"`, `"week"`, `"time"`, `"datetime-local"`, `"color"`, or
`"file"`.

The example below shows you how to open a browser date picker.

```html/9
<input type="date">
<button>Show the date picker</button>

<script>
  const button = document.querySelector("button");
  const dateInput = document.querySelector("input");

  button.addEventListener("click", () => {
    try {
      dateInput.showPicker();
      // A date picker is shown.
    } catch (error) {
      // Use external library when this fails.
    }
  });
</script>
```

A browser picker can also be prepopulated with items from `<datalist>` or
`"autocomplete"`.

The example below shows you how to open a browser picker with `<datalist>`.

```html/16
<datalist id="ice-cream-flavors">
  <option value="Chocolate"> </option>
  <option value="Coconut"> </option>
  <option value="Mint"> </option>
  <option value="Strawberry"> </option>
  <option value="Vanilla"> </option>
</datalist>
<input type="text" list="ice-cream-flavors">
<button>Show the suggestions</button>

<script>
  const button = document.querySelector("button");
  const iceCreamFlavorsInput = document.querySelector("input");

  button.addEventListener("click", () => {
    try {
      iceCreamFlavorsInput.showPicker();
      // A picker containing some ice cream flavors is shown.
    } catch (error) {
      // Use external library when this fails.
    }
  });
</script>
```

## Feature detection {: #feature-detection }

To check if `showPicker()` is supported, use:

```js
if ('showPicker' in HTMLInputElement.prototype) {
  // showPicker() is supported.
}
```

## Demo

A demo is available at [https://show-picker.glitch.me/demo.html][demo] for you
to play with all pickers supported by the browser.

autoplay="true", muted="true", loop="true", class="screenshot" %}

## Browser support

`showPicker()` is available in Chrome&nbsp;99 or later.

## What's next {: #future }

At the time of writing, `showPicker()` is new to the web platform. The feature
may need additional work in the future:

- We may want to add a similar `showPicker()` to the `<select>` element in the
  future, if web developers ask for it.
- It's possible `closePicker()` might be useful, and we could consider adding
  that if web developers ask for it.
- We could add a [permissions policy] which allows cross-origin iframes to show
  browser pickers when their parent chain allows them to do so.

## Feedback {: #feedback }

The Chrome team and the web standards community want to hear about your
experiences with `showPicker()`.

### Tell us about the design

Is there something about `showPicker()` that doesn't work like you expected? Or
are there missing methods or properties that you need to implement your idea?
Have a question or comment on the security model?

- File a spec issue on the [WHATWG GitHub repo][issues], or add your thoughts to
  an existing issue.

### Problem with the implementation?

Did you find a bug with Chrome's implementation? Or is the implementation
different from the spec?

- File a bug at <https://new.crbug.com>. Be sure to include as much detail as
  you can, and simple instructions for reproducing. [Glitch](https://glitch.com)
  works great for sharing quick and easy repros.

### Show support

Are you planning to use `showPicker()`? Your public support helps the Chrome
team prioritize features and shows other browser vendors how critical it is to
support them.

Send a tweet to [@ChromiumDev] and let us know where and how you are using it.
