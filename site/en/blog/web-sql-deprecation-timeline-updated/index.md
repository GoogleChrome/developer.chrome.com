Web SQL was first proposed in April 2009 and abandoned in November 2010. Gecko
never implemented it and WebKit removed it in 2019. Web SQL was removed for
third-party contexts in Chromium 97. Chromium 105 deprecated Web SQL in
insecure contexts and showed a warning in the DevTools Issue panel when the
feature is used. Chromium 110 removed Web SQL in insecure contexts. Complete
removal in insecure contexts and eventually all contexts is planned for Chromium 119.

- [‚úÖ Done.] Web SQL was deprecated and removed for **third-party contexts** in
  **Chromium&nbsp;97** ({% ChromeDate '96' %}).
- [‚úÖ Done.] Web SQL access in **insecure contexts** was deprecated as of
  **Chromium&nbsp;105** ({% ChromeDate '105' %}) at which time a warning message
  was shown in the Chrome DevTools Issue panel.

- [‚úÖ Done.] Web SQL access in **insecure contexts** is no longer
  available as of **Chromium&nbsp;110** ({% ChromeDate '110' %}). An
  **enterprise policy** to keep using the feature is available from
  **Chromium&nbsp;110** ({% ChromeDate '110' %}) to **Chromium&nbsp;123**
  ({% ChromeDate '123' %}).
- [‚úÖ Done.] Web SQL access in **all contexts** is deprecated as of
  **Chromium&nbsp;115** ({% ChromeDate '115' %}) and a warning message is shown
  in the Chrome DevTools Issue panel.
- [üìç We are here.] A
  [deprecation trial](/origintrials/#/view_trial/494270059103911937) to
  keep using Web SQL is available from **Chromium&nbsp;117**
  ({% ChromeDate '117' %}) to **Chromium&nbsp;123** ({% ChromeDate '123' %}).
  To learn more about deprecation trials, see the linked section of the article [Get started with origin trials](/docs/web-platform/origin-trials/#deprecation-trials).
- [üîÆ In the future.] Web SQL access in **all contexts** is no longer available
  in **Chromium&nbsp;119** ({% ChromeDate '119' %}).
