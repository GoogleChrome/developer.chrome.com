Starting with Chrome 119, the Chrome team is again reducing the time between the branch for a release, and the actual release to stable. This change builds on the success of the [previous time reduction](/blog/faster-chrome-releases/), and continues our efforts to shorten the time it takes to launch.

This will change the release date for Chrome stable and [early stable](/blog/early-stable/). 

The following table shows how this change affects the 119 release.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Stage</th>
      <th>Chrome 119 (Old)</th>
      <th>Chrome 119 (Revised)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Branch </td>
      <td>Tue, Oct 3</td>
      <td><strong>Mon, Oct 2</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Beta Promotion</td>
      <td>Wed, Oct 11</td>
      <td><strong>Wed, Oct 4</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Stable Cut</td>
      <td>Tue, Oct 31</td>
      <td><strong>Tue, Oct 24</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Early Stable Release</td>
      <td>Wed, Nov 1</td>
      <td><strong>Wed, Oct 25</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Stable Release</td>
      <td>Tue, Nov 7</td>
      <td><strong>Tue, Oct 31</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Note that Chrome 120 stable will release on December 6 due to this change, and all dates after this have been adjusted to account for this.

You can keep track of upcoming releases on the [Chrome Status Roadmap](https://chromestatus.com/roadmap), and see the schedule in detail on the [Chromium Dashboard](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/schedule). We publish a post on this site for each [beta release](/tags/beta/), so you can keep track of upcoming changes to Chrome.
