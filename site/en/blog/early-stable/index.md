We are making a change to the release schedule for Chrome. From Chrome 110, the initial release date to stable will be one week earlier. This _early stable_ version will be released to a small percentage of users, with the majority of people getting the release a week later at the normal scheduled date, this will also be the date the new version is available from the Chrome download page.

For Chrome 110 the key dates will be:

-  **Beta:** January 12, 2023
-  **Early Stable:** February 1, 2023
-  **Stable:** February 7, 2023

You can keep track of upcoming release dates and included features on the [Chrome Status Roadmap](https://chromestatus.com/roadmap), and on the [Chromium Dashboard](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/schedule). The [beta posts](/tags/beta/) have more details of features, and any deprecations and removals for each release.

## Why are we making this change?

By releasing stable to a small percentage of users early, we get a chance to monitor the release before it rolls out to all of our users. If any showstopping issue is discovered, it can be addressed while the impact is relatively small. 

For most developers this change will have little impact. Keep following this blog for up to date information on features and any upcoming deprecations and removals. We aim to bring you any relevant information in good time for you to act upon it, before any change in Chrome.
