CSS color 4 brings a large set of tools and features to CSS for managing and
handling color. I've written the [High Definition Color
Guide](/articles/high-definition-css-color-guide/) to cover all these new
features. In this guide you will learn:

- What is a color gamut?
- Human visual gamut.
- What is a color space?
- How to access more colors, new spaces, and debug results.
- A review of the classic color spaces.
- Meet the new web color spaces.
- Color interpolation.
- Gamut clamping.
- Choosing a color space.
- Migrating to HD CSS color.
- Checking for gamut and color space support.
- Debugging color with Chrome DevTools.

I hope this finds you well and answers all your color questions. ðŸ™‚
