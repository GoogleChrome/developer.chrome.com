The open web platform is changing at an ever increasing rate. Many developers find it hard to keep up with the pace the browsers are implementing new HTML5 features, including ourselves. There are a ton of new APIs, demos, libraries, and announcements, every day. 

In an effort to info developers quicker, we've built this "HTML5 Update Stream" to highlight the cool things worth sharing. At first, the updates will include new tutorials on HTML5Rocks, demos we find, and Chromium updates. Over time, we hope to automagically aggregate more stuff. 

Posts in the stream will contain more content than a Tweet but less than a blog post. Look out for useful code snippets, screenshots, demo links, and more! 

Cheers,

Eric
