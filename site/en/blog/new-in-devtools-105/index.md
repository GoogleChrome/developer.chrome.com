## Step-by-step replay in the Recorder {: #recorder }

You can now set a breakpoint and replay a user flow step by step in the **Recorder** panel.

To set a breakpoint, click on the blue dot next to a step. Replay your user flow, the replay will pause before executing the step. From here, you can continue the replay, execute a step, or cancel the replay.

With this feature, you can fully visualize and debug your user flow with ease.

See [Recorder features reference](/docs/devtools/recorder/reference/) for more information.

Chromium issue: [1257499](https://crbug.com/1257499)


## Support mouse over event in the Recorder panel {: #recorder-hover }

The **Recorder** now supports adding a mouse over (hover) step manually in a recording. 

[This demo](https://jec.fyi/demo/menu-hover) shows a pop up menu on hover. Try to record a user flow and click a menu item.

If you replay the user flow now, it will fail because the **Recorder** doesn’t capture mouse over events automatically during recording. To resolve this, [add a step manually](/docs/devtools/recorder/reference/#add-and-remove-steps) to hover over the selector before clicking the menu item.

## Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) in the Performance insights panel {: #lcp }

LCP is an important, user-centric metric for measuring [perceived load speed](https://web.dev/user-centric-performance-metrics/#types-of-metrics). You can now find out the critical paths and root causes of a [Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)](https://web.dev/lcp/).

In a [performance recording](/docs/devtools/performance-insights/#record), click on the LCP badge in the **Timeline**. In the **Details** pane, you can view the LCP score, learn how to fix resources that slow down the LCP and see the critical path for the LCP resource.

See [Performance Insights](/docs/devtools/performance-insights/) to learn how to get actionable insights and improve your website’s performance with the panel.

Chromium issue: [1326481](https://crbug.com/1326481)


## Identify flashes of text (FOIT, FOUT) as potential root causes for layout shifts {: #foit-fout }

The **Performance insights** panel now detects [flash of invisible text (FOIT) and flash of unstyled text (FOUT)](https://web.dev/preload-optional-fonts/#font-rendering) as potential root causes for layout shifts.

To view the potential root causes of a layout shift, click on a screenshot in the **Layout shifts** track.

See [Optimize WebFont loading and rendering](https://web.dev/optimize-webfont-loading/) to learn the technique to prevent layout shifts.

## Protocol handlers in the Manifest pane {: #manifest }

You can now use DevTools to test the [URL protocol handler registration](https://web.dev/url-protocol-handler/) for [Progressive Web Apps (PWA)](https://web.dev/learn/pwa/).

The URL protocol handler registration lets installed PWAs handle links that use a specific protocol (e.g. [`magnet`](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme), `web+example`) for a more integrated experience.

Navigate to the **Protocol Handlers** section via the **Application** > **Manifest** pane. You can view and test all the available protocols here.

For example, install [this demo PWA](https://protocol-handler.glitch.me/). In the **Protocol Handlers** section, type “americano” and click **Test protocol** to open the coffee page in the PWA.

## Top layer badge in the Elements panel {: #top-layer }

Use the [top layer badge](/blog/top-layer-devtools/#top-layer-support-design-in-devtools) to understand the concept of the top layer and visualize how the top layer content changes. 

The [`<dialog>` element](https://web.dev/building-a-dialog-component/) has recently become stable across browsers. When you open a dialog, it is put into a [top layer](/blog/top-layer-devtools/). Top level content renders on top of all the other content. 

In this [demo](https://jec.fyi/demo/dialog), click **Open dialog**. 

To help visualize the top layer elements, DevTools adds a top layer container (`#top-layer`) to the DOM tree. It resides after the closing `</html>` tag.  

To jump from the top layer container element to the top layer tree element, click the **reveal** button next to the element or its backdrop in the top layer container.

Next to the top layer tree element (for example, the dialog element), click the **top-layer** badge to jump to the top layer container.

Chromium issue: [1313690](https://crbug.com/1313690)


## Attach Wasm debugging information at runtime {: #wasm }

You can now attach DWARF debugging information for wasm during runtime. Previously, the **Sources** panel only supported attaching sourcemaps to JavaScript and Wasm files.

Open a Wasm file in the **Sources** panel. Right-click in the editor and select **Add DWARF debugging info…**  to attach debugging information on demand.

Chromium issue: [1341255](https://crbug.com/1341255)


## Support live edit during debugging {: #live-edit }

You can now edit the top-most function on the stack without restarting the debugger.

In Chrome 104, DevTools brings back the [restart frame](/blog/new-in-devtools-104/) feature. However, you weren't able to edit the function you are currently paused in. It is common for developers to break in a function and then edit that function while paused. 

With this update, the debugger automatically restarts the function with the following restrictions:

- Only the top-most function can be edited while paused
- No recursive call on the same function further down the stack

Chromium issue: [1334484](https://crbug.com/1334484)


## View and edit @scope at rules in the Styles pane {: #scope }

You can now view and edit the [CSS `@scope` at-rules](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-cascade-6/#scope-atrule) in the **Styles** pane. 

The `@scope` at rules is part of the [CSS Cascading and Inheritance Level 6 specification](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-cascade-6/). These rules allow developers to scope style rules in CSS.

Open [this demo page](https://codepen.io/miriamsuzanne/details/ZErXZVY) and inspect the hyperlink within the `<div class=”dark-theme”>` element. In the **Styles** pane, view the `@scope` at-rules. Click the rule declaration to edit it.

{% Aside %}
The CSS `@scope` is currently under development. To test this feature, enable the **Experimental Web Platform features** flag via `chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features`.
{% endAside %}

Chromium issue: [1337777](https://crbug.com/1337777)


## Sourcemap improvements {: #sourcemaps }

Here are a few fixes on sourcemaps to improve the overall debugging experience:

- DevTools now properly resolves sourcemap identifiers with punctuation. Some modern minifiers (for example, [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/)) produce sourcemaps that merge identifiers
with subsequent punctuation (comma, parentheses, semicolon). 
- DevTools now resolves sourcemap names for constructors with a `super` call.

- Fixed source map URL indexing for duplicate canonical URLs. Previously, breakpoints were not activated in some files because of duplicate canonical URLs.


Chromium issue: [1335338](https://crbug.com/1335338), [1333411](https://crbug.com/1333411)


## Miscellaneous highlights {: #misc }
 
These are some noteworthy fixes in this release:

- Properly remove a local storage key value pair from the table in the **Application** > **Local Storage** pane when it is deleted. ([1339280](https://crbug.com/1339280))
- The color previews are now correctly displayed when viewing CSS files in the **Sources** panel. Previously, their positions were misplaced. ([1340062](https://crbug.com/1340062))
- Consistently display the CSS flex and grid items in the **Layout** pane, as well as display them as badges in the **Elements** panel. Previously, the flex and grid items were randomly missing in both places. ([1340441](https://crbug.com/1340441), [1273992](https://crbug.com/1273992))
- A new **Creator Ad Script** link is available for [ad frames](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/ad_tagging.md#adtracker) if DevTools found the script that caused the frame to be labeled as an ad. You can open a frame via **Application** > **Frames**. ([1217041](https://crbug.com/1217041))
