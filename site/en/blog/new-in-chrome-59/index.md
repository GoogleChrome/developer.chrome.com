* [Headless Chrome](#headless) allows you to run Chrome in an automated
  environment without a user interface or peripherals.
* [Notifications on macOS](#macnot) will be shown directly by the native
  macOS notification system.

I'm Pete LePage. Let's dive in and see what's new for developers in Chrome 59!

## Headless Chrome {: #headless }

A headless browser is a great tool for running automated tests and server
environments where you don't need to see the rendered output or have a
visible UI shell. For example:

* Using Selenium for unit tests against your progressive web app
* To create a PDF of a wikipedia page
* Inspecting a page with DevTools

Starting in Chrome 59, you can now run headless Chrome. It brings all modern web
platform features provided by Chrome to the command line.

Check out [Eric Bidelman's post on Updates](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome)
for full details. He's got examples on how you can use it to convert pages to
PDF, dump the DOM and how to use it programmatically in Node.

## Native notifications on macOS {: #macnot }

Chrome has historically included its own notification system for web and
extension developers to show notifications to users. But, we've heard from users
and developers alike that they want Chrome to use the native OS notification
system.

Starting in Chrome 59 on mac OS, Chrome will use the native notification system,
improving the user experience and ensuring that the notifications feel more
integrated in the platform. My personal favorite, notifications will now respect
my do not disturb settings.

Because of the way macOS handles notifications, there are a few low usage APIs
that are now discouraged, as they'll result in a degraded experience on macOS.

Check out our [Updates post](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/native-mac-os-notifications)
for all the details.

## Image capture API {: #imagecapture }

Capturing high res photos in a web app can be hard. Either the user has to
upload a photo they've already taken, or switch from the browser to the camera,
take the photo, switch back to the browser and upload the photo.

With the new Image Capture API in Chrome 59, you have to access the full
resolution capabilities of any available camera. The API provides control of
features such as zoom, brightness, contrast, ISO and even white balance.

Check [Sam's post](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/12/imagecapture) for full details and
sample code you can use to get started right away.

## And more! {: #more }

* The [`MediaError.message`](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/media/error-message.html)
  string provides, if available, any additional error message detail to help
  web developers debugging media player errors.

These are just a few of the changes in Chrome 59 for developers.
