[Chrome Dev Summit](/devsummit/?utm_campaign=chrome_discussion_devsummitwelcome_110716&utm_source=gdev&utm_medium=plus)
is almost here! We'll kick off live from San Francisco at the
[SFJAZZ Center](https://www.google.com/maps/place/SFJAZZ+Center/@37.7762655,-122.4235699,17z),
at 10:00 AM PT this coming Thursday, Nov 10th. This year's summit will focus
on key themes that matter to you: Progressive, to build high quality web apps;
Performance, to increase user engagement; and What's Next, a look at how the
Chrome team is thinking about the future of the web.

While we're putting the finishing touches on the keynote, sessions, and code
labs, we wanted to provide you with some tips to get ready to experience
Chrome Dev Summit, either in-person or via the
[livestream](/devsummit?utm_campaign=chrome_discussion_devsummitwelcome_110716&utm_source=gdev&utm_medium=plus/).
