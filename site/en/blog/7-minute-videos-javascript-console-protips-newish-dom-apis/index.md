I recently recorded some videos from the comfy red chair in our office. Probably some useful things here to learn.

Level up on the JavaScript console in the Chrome DevTools. Look at XHR requests, learn console helper functions to monitor events or explore objects better. We dive into all sorts of goodies in the command lines API: `console.time`, `$0`, `inspect()`, `$$`, `monitorEvents()`, `keys()`, `values()`, and `copy()`.

In this one, I give you a heads up on recent DOM APIs with good browser support that were designed to make things easier for you. HTML5 `classList`, `dataset`, `matchMedia()`, `textContent`, and `matchesSelector()` are explained and demonstrated.
