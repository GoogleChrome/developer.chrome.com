[Previous episodes](/tags/chromium-chronicle/)

Want to detect regressions for your new feature in Chrome? Add your
tests to **the waterfall** (Chrome's continuous build and test infrastructure)!

There are many builders on Chrome's waterfall that run tests on a variety of
platforms. This article describes how to add a test suite to an existing
builder. Before proceeding, consider these questions:

*Should the new tests live in a brand new suite, or just be added to an existing one?*

* Tests are organized in test suites by **proximity of source location and theme.**
  If your new tests can't logically fit into any existing suite, you probably
  need a new suite.

*Should the tests run on a public builder or an internal builder?*

* Use an **internal builder** if the code lives in an **internal repo**, or the
  tests involve **confidential data**.

*Should the tests run in FYI CI, main CI or commit queue(CQ)?*

* FYI CI needs your self-monitoring and is used for test refinement or
  experimentation.
* **Main CI tests are regularly monitored** by sheriffs.
* **CQ blocks CL submission** at failure but **takes more infra resources**.
  A new suite should always **start from CI before being promoted to CQ**.
* If you're not sure, your platform's **EngProd team** can help you decide.

*I already have a test suite running in CI, how do I add it to CQ? / What if I
need a new builder?*

* [File a bug in Infra>Client>Chrome component][inf-cli-bug] so
  `chrome-browser-infra@` team can start evaluations and help you set up.

## How to add a test suite to an existing builder

To **add a test suite to an existing builder**, you need to config some files
in [`//src/testing/buildbot/`][src-test-bbot]:

1. **Create a key** in [`gn_isolate_map.pyl`][gn-iso-map] for the new test suite
   with test target label and type info.
2. **Add that key to a test group** in [`test_suites.pyl`][test-suites-pyl].
   (You can find the mapping from builder name to the test groups on builder in
   [`waterfalls.pyl`][waterfalls-pyl].)

    ```json
    'all_simulator_tests': {
      'previously_existing_test_suite': {},
      'exciting_new_feature_test_suite': {},
    },
    ```

3. More fine tunings.
     * [`mixins.pyl`][mixins-pyl] contains **arguments** that
       can be applied to a group of tests at various group levels.
     * [`variants.pyl`][variants-pyl] helps run a suite **in multiple instances
       with different arguments**.
4. **Regenerate configuration files** by running
   [`generate_buildbot_json.py`][gen-bbot-py].

After these, it is a simple matter of **checking in** your config changes;
the builders running this suite will pick up the new tests automatically, and
the **results will begin to flow in on the web interface** for the builder on
the waterfall - complete with plenty of debug info in the case of failures!
