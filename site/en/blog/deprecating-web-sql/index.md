title: Deprecating and removing Web SQL
description: >
  Web SQL was first proposed in April 2009 and abandoned in November 2010. Gecko never implemented
  it and WebKit removed it in 2019. Web SQL was removed for third-party contexts in Chromium 97. Now
  Chromium 105 deprecates Web SQL in insecure contexts and shows a warning in the DevTools Issue
  panel when the feature is used. Complete removal in insecure contexts and eventually all contexts
  is planned for later Chromium releases.

{% Aside %} This is a living post that will be updated as the deprecation steps outlined below
happen. {% endAside %}

The [Web SQL Database API](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/), which allows you to store data in a
structured manner on the user's computer (internally based on the SQLite database engine), was
[introduced in April 2009](https://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-webdatabase-20091222/) and
[abandoned in November 2010](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/#status-of-this-document). While it
was implemented in WebKit (which powers Safari and early versions of Chrome) and remained active in
the Blink engine (that powers Chrome after the switch from WebKit), Gecko (which powers Firefox)
never implemented this feature and
[WebKit removed it in 2019](https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/2019-November/030968.html).

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
[encourages](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/#:~:text=The%20Web%20Applications%20Working%20Group%20continues%20work%20on%20two%20other%20storage%2Drelated%20specifications%3A%20Web%20Storage%20and%20Indexed%20Database%20API.)
those needing web databases to adopt
[Web Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API) technologies like
[`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) and
[`sessionStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage), or
[IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API/Using_IndexedDB). These
technologies show their strengths when it comes to key/value stores and structured data, but
acknowledgely also have weaknesses like the lack of a strong query language. People want SQL on the
web for a reason.

{% Aside %} Our intention is to empower developers to create their own solutions for structured
storage and we're therefore working with the [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) team to
create a SQLite implementation over WebAssembly. This solution will replace Web SQL. {% endAside %}

## Web SQL deprecation steps

- [‚úÖ Done.] Web SQL was deprecated and removed for **third-party contexts** in
  **Chromium&nbsp;97**.
- [üìç We are here.] Web SQL access in **insecure contexts** is deprecated as of
  **Chromium&nbsp;105** at which time a warning message will be shown in the Chrome DevTools Issue
  panel.

{% Img src="image/8WbTDNrhLsU0El80frMBGE4eMCD3/AunrHQyWXS6AmECRn9oT.png", alt="Chrome DevTools Issues panel with a warning that reads Web SQL in non-secure contexts is deprecated.", width="800", height="158" %}

- [üîÆ In the future.] Web SQL access in **insecure contexts** will be completely removed in a later
  milestone.
- [üîÆ In the future.] The final step will be to remove Web SQL completely **in all contexts**, but
  no date has been set for this step yet.

## Where to go from here

As pointed out in the introduction,
[Web Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API) technologies like
[`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) and
[`sessionStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage), or the
[IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API/Using_IndexedDB) standard are
good alternatives in many, but by far not all cases.

We're therefore working with the SQLite community on a replacement for Web SQL based on SQLite
implemented in WebAssembly (Wasm), which will be released in the near future. For developers looking
for a drop-in replacement, we're investigating if a shim script can be provided. The article will be
updated once the replacement is ready.

### Rationale for leaving storage to web developers

With the advent of Wasm, SQL or NoSQL solutions can come to the web. One example is
[DuckDB-Wasm](https://duckdb.org/2021/10/29/duckdb-wasm.html), another is
[absurd-sql](https://github.com/jlongster/absurd-sql). Based on these creations, we feel that the
developer community can iterate on and create new storage solutions faster and better than browser
vendors.

We're not planning to just remove Web SQL. In fact, we're planning to replace it with something that
will be maintained by the open-source community, served as a package that can be updated at
will‚Äîwithout the burden of introducing fixes and new features directly into browsers. Our objective
really is to let developers bring their own database to the web.

What's more, we're hoping that this example will help a new ecosystem of open-source databases to
flourish! The release of
[file system access handles](https://web.dev/file-system-access/#accessing-files-optimized-for-performance-from-the-origin-private-file-system)
finally provides the new primitive on which custom storage solutions can be built.

## Reasons for deprecating Web SQL

### Sustainability and security concerns

The Web SQL specification cannot be implemented sustainably, which limits innovation and new
functionality. The last version of the standard literally
[states](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/#web-sql) _"User agents must implement the SQL dialect
supported by Sqlite 3.6.19"_. SQLite was not initially designed to run malicious SQL statements, yet
implementing Web SQL means browsers have to do exactly this. The need to keep up with security and
stability fixes dictates updating SQLite in Chromium. This comes in direct conflict with Web SQL's
requirement of behaving exactly as SQLite 3.6.19.

### API shape

Web SQL also is an API that shows its age. Being a child of the late 2000s, it's a great example of
"callback hell", as the code sample
([courtesy of Nolan Lawson](https://nolanlawson.com/2014/04/26/web-sql-database-in-memoriam/)) below
impressively demonstrates. As you can see, the SQL statements (using the
[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) SQL dialect) are passed as strings to the database
methods.

```js
openDatabase(
  // Name
  'mydatabase',
  // Version
  1,
  // Display name
  'mydatabase',
  // Estimated size
  5000000,
  // Creation callback
  function (db) {
    db.transaction(
      // Transaction callback
      function (tx) {
        // Execute SQL statement
        tx.executeSql(
          // SQL statement
          'create table rainstorms (mood text, severity int)',
          // Arguments
          [],
          // Success callback
          function () {
            // Execute SQL statement
            tx.executeSql(
              // SQL statement
              'insert into rainstorms values (?, ?)',
              // Arguments
              ['somber', 6],
              // Success callback
              function () {
                // Execute SQL statement
                tx.executeSql(
                  // SQL statement
                  'select * from rainstorms where mood = ?',
                  // Arguments
                  ['somber'],
                  // Success callback
                  function (tx, res) {
                    // Do something with the result
                    var row = res.rows.item(0);
                    console.log('rainstorm severity: ' + row.severity + ',  my mood: ' + row.mood);
                  },
                );
              },
            );
          },
        );
      },
      // Error callback
      function (err) {
        console.log('Transaction failed!: ' + err);
      },
      // Success callback);
      function () {
        console.log('Transaction succeeded!');
      },
    );
  },
);
```

{% Aside 'warning' %} This code is obsolete. Don't use it in practice. {% endAside %}

If you were to run this code and
[inspect the created table with Chrome DevTools](/docs/devtools/storage/websql/), this is the
result:

{% Img src="image/8WbTDNrhLsU0El80frMBGE4eMCD3/MnkvXruPWsb89lFTynqX.png", alt="Inspecting the Web SQL section in Chrome DevTools shows a database called mydatabase with a table called rainstorms with the columns mood (textual) and severity (integer) that has one entry with a mood of somber and a severity of six.", width="800", height="187" %}

### Lack of implementer support

Apart from the arcane API shape (at least from today's point of view), Mozilla had many
[concerns](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2010/06/beyond-html5-database-apis-and-the-road-to-indexeddb/)
about Web SQL being built upon SQLite:

_"We don't think [SQLite] is the right basis for an API exposed to general web content, not least of
all because there isn't a credible, widely accepted standard that subsets SQL in a useful way.
Additionally, we don't want changes to SQLite to affect the web later, and don't think harnessing
major browser releases (and a web standard) to SQLite is prudent."_
