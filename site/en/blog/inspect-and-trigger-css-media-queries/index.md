Use the __Media Query Inspector__ to inspect and trigger the registered breakpoints on a page. In Device Mode, click the icon which looks like __staggered bars__ in the upper left corner of the page, the MQI opens.

You can trigger the various breakpoints with a click on a bar. If you right click on a bar, you can reveal its position within the source code.
