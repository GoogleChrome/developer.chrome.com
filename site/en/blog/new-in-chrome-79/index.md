* And plenty more.

I'm [Pete LePage](https://petelepage.com/), let's dive in and see what's
new for developers in Chrome 79!

## Maskable Icons {: #maskable-icons }

If you're running Android O or later, and you've installed a Progressive Web
App, you've probably noticed the annoying white circle around the icon.

{# TODO(petele): video element, float-right, auto-play #}
<figure class="float-right">
{% Video src=[
  "video/0g2WvpbGRGdVs0aAPc6ObG7gkud2/cjPOLN1GYdcOzAQfLer9.webm",
  "video/0g2WvpbGRGdVs0aAPc6ObG7gkud2/sgGdDrY5eBVo43VP2iyW.mp4"
  ]
%}
</figure>

Thankfully, Chrome 79 now supports maskable icons for installed Progressive
Web Apps.You'll need to design your icon to fit within the safe zone -
essentially a circle with a diameter that's 80% of the canvas.

Then, in the web app manifest, you'll need to add a new `purpose` property to
the icon, and set its value to `maskable`.

<br style="clear:both;">

```json
{
  ...
  "icons": [
    ...
    {
      "src": "path/to/maskable_icon.png",
      "sizes": "196x196",
      "type": "image/png",
      "purpose": "maskable"
  ]
  ...
}
```

Tiger Oakes has a great post on CSS Tricks - [Maskable Icons: Android Adaptive
Icons for Your PWA][oakes-maskable] with all of the details, and has a great
tool you can use for testing your icons to make sure they'll fit.

## Web XR {: #webxr }

You can now create immersive experiences for smartphones and head-mounted
displays with the WebXR Device API.

WebXR enables a whole spectrum of immersive experiences. From using augmented
reality to see what a new couch might look like in your home before you buy
it, to virtual reality games and 360 degree movies, and more.

To get started with the new API, read [Virtual Reality Comes to the Web][webxr].

## New origin trials {: #origin-trials }

Origin trials provide an opportunity for us to validate experimental features
and APIs, and make it possible for you to provide feedback on their usability
and effectiveness in broader deployment.

{% Img src="image/0g2WvpbGRGdVs0aAPc6ObG7gkud2/b8W2avaeSBFf7PhZcxAX.png", alt="", class="float-right", height="590", width="800" %}

Experimental features are typically only available behind a flag, but when we
offer an Origin Trial for a feature, you can register for that origin trial
to enable the feature for all users on your origin.

Opting into an origin trial allows you to build demos and prototypes that
your beta testing users can try for the duration of the trial without
requiring them to flip any special flags in Chrome.

There's more info on origin trials in the
[Origin Trials Guide for Web Developers][ot-for-web-devs]. You can see a list
of active origin trials, and sign up for them on the
[Chrome Origin Trials][ot-listing] page.

### Wake Lock {: #wake-lock }

One of my biggest pet peeves about Google Slides is that if you leave the
deck open on a single slide for too long, the screensaver kicks in. Before you
can continue, you need to unlock your computer. Ugh.

But, with the new Wake Lock API, a page can request a lock, and prevent the
screen from dimming or the screensaver from kicking in. It's perfect for
Slides, but it's also helpful for things like recipe sites - where you might
want to keep the screen on while you follow the instructions.

To request a wake lock, you need to call `navigator.wakeLock.request()`, and
save the `WakeLockSentinel` object that it returns.

```js
// The wake lock sentinel.
let wakeLock = null;

// Function that attempts to request a wake lock.
const requestWakeLock = async () => {
  try {
    wakeLock = await navigator.wakeLock.request('screen');
    wakeLock.addEventListener('release', () => {
      console.log('Wake Lock was released');
    });
    console.log('Wake Lock is active');
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(`${err.name}, ${err.message}`);
  }
};
```

The lock is maintained until the user navigates away from the page, or you call
`release` on the `WakeLockSentinel` object you saved earlier.

```js
// Function that attempts to release the wake lock.
const releaseWakeLock = async () => {
  if (!wakeLock) {
    return;
  }
  try {
    await wakeLock.release();
    wakeLock = null;
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(`${err.name}, ${err.message}`);
  }
};
```

More details are at [web.dev/wakelock](https://web.dev/wakelock).

### `rendersubtree` attribute {: #rendersubtree }

There are times when you don't want part of the DOM to render immediately.
For example scrollers with a large amount of content, or tabbed UIs where
only some of the content is visible at any given time.

The new `rendersubtree` attribute tells the browser it can skip rendering that
subtree. This allows the browser to spend more time processing the rest of the
page, increasing performance.

When `rendersubtree` is set to `invisible`, the element's content is not
drawn or hit-tested, allowing for rendering optimizations.

Changing the `rendersubtree` to `activatable`, makes the content visible by
removing the `invisible` attribute, and rendering the content.
