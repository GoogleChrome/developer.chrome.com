Hallo! It's [Kayce](https://twitter.com/kaycebasques) again, tech writer for DevTools. For this DevTools Digest I thought I'd switch it up a little and do a roundup of some perf tooling improvements in DevTools over the last few Chrome releases.

All features are already in Chrome Stable unless noted otherwise.

## CPU throttling for a mobile-first world

*Available in Chrome 54, which is currently 
[Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html).*

Software is eating the world, and mobile is eating software. DevTools is steadily evolving to better meet the needs of a mobile-first development world. The latest development in DevTools' mobile-first tooling is CPU Throttling. Use this feature to gain better awareness of how your site performs on resource-constrained devices.

Select one of the options from the **CPU Throttling** dropdown menu on the Timeline panel to handicap the computing power of your development machine.

</figure>


Some notes about CPU throttling:

* Throttling immediately takes effect and continues until you disable it, just like network throttling. 
* This feature is for general awareness of how your site would probably perform on a resource-constrained device. It's impossible for DevTools to truly emulate the performance characteristics of a mobile system on chip.
* Throttling is relative to your development machine. In other words, 5x throttling on a top-of-the-line desktop will yield different results than 5x throttling on a five-year-old budget laptop.

With that said, combine CPU Throttling with [Network Throttling](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network-performance/reference#throttling) and [Device Mode](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode/), and you start to get a much better picture about how your site will look and perform on mobile devices, right from the convenience of your development machine browser.

## Network view in timeline recordings

Enable the **Network** checkbox next time you take a Timeline recording to analyze how your page downloaded its resources. Click on a resource to view more information about it in the Summary pane.

<figure>

</figure>



The **Initiator** field in the summary is particularly useful. This field tells you where the resource is being requested.

## Passive event listeners

Passive event listeners are an emerging standard to improve scroll performance. Check out this article by yours truly to learn more:

[Improving scroll performance with passive event listeners](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/06/passive-event-listeners)

DevTools has shipped a couple features to help you find listeners that could benefit from a little `{passive: true}` love.

First off, the Console emits a warning when a synchronous listener is blocking page scroll for unreasonable amounts of time.

<figure>

</figure>


You can test this out for yourself in the demo below:

[Scroll jank due to touch/wheel handlers demo](https://rbyers.github.io/scroll-latency.html)

Next, you can use the little dropdown menu on the **Event Listeners** pane to filter for passive or blocking listeners.

<figure>

</figure>

Last, you can toggle the passive or blocking state of a listener by hovering over it and pressing **Toggle Passive**. This feature is currently limited to `touchstart`, `touchmove`, `mousewheel`, and `wheel` event listeners.

<figure>
{% Img src="image/T4FyVKpzu4WKF1kBNvXepbi08t52/fJtiB269BM4fxzfG3hxa.png", alt="Toggle passive", width="655", height="277" %}
</figure>

I'll wrap this section up with a little tip. Enable the **Scrolling Performance Issues** checkbox on the Rendering drawer to get a visual representation of potential scrolling issues. When a section of a page is highlighted, it means that there is a listener bound to that section of the page that might negatively affect scroll performance.

</figure>

## Group by activity

Back in mid-June the **Call Tree** pane on the Timeline panel got a new sorting category: Group by Activity. This grouping lets you view how much time your page spent parsing HTML, evaluating scripts, painting, and so on.

<figure>

</figure>

## Timeline stats in the sources panel

Create a Timeline recording with the **JS Profile** option enabled, and you can see a function-by-function breakdown of execution times in the Sources panel.
