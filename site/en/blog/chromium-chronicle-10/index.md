Chrome's testing strategy relies heavily on automated functional correctness
tests and manual testing, but neither of these reliably catch minor UI
regressions. **Use pixel tests to automate testing your desktop browser UI.**

When writing a pixel test, avoid flakiness by: (1) disabling animation,
(2) using mock data, and (3) testing the minimum possible surface area.

Here is a sample image used to verify pixel correctness for the omnibox:

{% img src="image/0g2WvpbGRGdVs0aAPc6ObG7gkud2/WdIk74i8zUDGYrHX44FP.png", alt="Omnibox image used for pixel comparison.", width="745", height="28" %}

And the code to verify the browser matches this image:

```cpp
IN_PROC_BROWSER_TEST_F(SkiaGoldDemoPixelTest, TestOmnibox) {
  // Always disable animation for stability.
  ui::ScopedAnimationDurationScaleMode disable_animation(
      ui::ScopedAnimationDurationScaleMode::ZERO_DURATION);
  GURL url("chrome://bookmarks");
  AddTabAtIndex(0, url, ui::PageTransition::PAGE_TRANSITION_FIRST);
  auto* const browser_view = BrowserView::GetBrowserViewForBrowser(browser());
  // CompareScreenshot() takes a screenshot and compares it with the
  // golden image, which was previously human-approved, is stored
  // server-side, and is managed by Skia Gold. If any pixels differ, the
  // test will fail and output a link for the author to triage the
  // new image.
  bool ret = GetPixelDiff().CompareScreenshot("omnibox",
      browser_view->GetLocationBarView());
  EXPECT_TRUE(ret);
}
```

This code lives at [chrome/test/pixel/demo/skia_gold_demo_pixeltest.cc][1].
The relevant headers are `skia_gold_pixel_diff.h` for unit tests and
`browser_skia_gold_pixel_diff.h` for browser tests.

The pixel diff and approval process is powered by Skia Gold. **Skia Gold pixel
tests provide a visual approval workflow, and allow developers to accept
small flakes by approving multiple gold images.**

Currently the test suite is running on the Windows FYI bot. Browser tests
and Views unit tests are supported.
