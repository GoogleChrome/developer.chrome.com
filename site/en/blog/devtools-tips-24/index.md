[Source maps](https://web.dev/articles/source-maps) let you keep your code readable and debuggable even after you've combined and minified it, without impacting performance. To learn how source maps work, see the [previous DevTools Tips video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIYkjjFYvoI).

Watch this video to learn how to work with source maps in DevTools:

- [Enable source maps](/docs/devtools/javascript/source-maps/#enable_source_maps_in_settings).
- Use [**Developer Resources**](/docs/devtools/developer-resources/) tab to check if source maps loaded successfully.
- If required, [load source maps manually](/docs/devtools/developer-resources/#load).
- [Debug your (mapped) original code](/docs/devtools/javascript/source-maps/#debugging_with_source_maps) instead of deployed as you normally would.
- [Group the files you author](/docs/devtools/javascript/reference/#group-authored-and-deployed) to navigate the file tree in **Sources** easier.
