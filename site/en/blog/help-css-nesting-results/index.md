Thank you to all of you that participated in [helping CSS pick a nesting
syntax](/blog/help-css-nesting/). The CSSWG has discussed the results and has
decided to move forwards with `@nest`. This unblocks the syntax issue, enabling
[the @nest spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-nesting-1/) to move forward.

## Results

Out of 7,590 total votes, `@nest` was a clear winner:

{% Img src="image/80mq7dk16vVEg8BBhsVe42n6zn82/8u6XZo3MyDuMmrUnx8UA.png", alt="A
bar chart with 3 columns: @nest, @nest always and brackets. @nest has 6661
votes, @nest always has 388 votes, and brackets has 541 votes.", width="800",
height="519" %}

87% of respondents voted for `@nest`, 5% for `@nest` always, and 7% for
brackets. Such a large split was not estimated but is relieving to the
discussions.

## What's next?

The CSSWG will continue to discuss the feature and move on to other issues.
You've all helped us very much, we really appreciate the time you took to
evaluate the options and provide feedback.
