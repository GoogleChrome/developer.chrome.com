In the styles pane, you can expand CSS shorthand properties like `flex` or `padding` and see the full range of properties which are defined for you. E.g.

```css
flex: 0 0 45%;
```

Translates to:

```css
flex-grow: 0;
flex-shrink: 0;
flex-basis: 45%;
```

Just click the small arrow near the shorthand property to expand it.
