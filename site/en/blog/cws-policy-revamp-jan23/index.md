We are announcing a set of policy updates designed to encourage the development
of high quality products, prevent deceptive behavior, and ensure informed user
consent. These updates include:

1. [Minimum Functionality Policy Update](/docs/webstore/program-policies/minimum-functionality/)
   &mdash;Expands our current Minimum Functionality Policy to include
   click-baity template extensions, empty extensions, and extensions that do not
   directly provide their stated functionality.

2. [Misleading and Deceptive Behavior Policy Update](/docs/webstore/program-policies/unexpected-behavior/)
   &mdash;Prohibits anti-virus, privacy, and security extensions that provide no
   discernible protection or monitoring.

3. [Affiliate Ads Policy](/docs/webstore/program-policies/affiliate-ads/)
   &mdash;Establishes new disclosure requirements for extensions that include
   affiliate ad programs. Developers will now be required to disclose any
   affiliate programs to users before installation. Additionally, related user
   action is required before the inclusion of affiliate codes, links, or
   cookies.

Developers can also learn more about today's guidance in our Program Policies.
These policy clarifications will go into effect on January 15, 2023. After that
date, extensions in violation of these new policies may be removed from the
Chrome Web Store and be disabled.

If you have any questions, you can contact developer support.

Thank you for your cooperation, and for your participation in the Chrome
extension ecosystem!

&mdash; The Google Chrome Web Store team
