The Console Utilities API lets you speed up your debugging workflow by providing a variety of shortcuts.

{% YouTube id='hdRDTj6ObiE' %}

With the Console Utilities API, you can:

- Stop typing long commands like `document.querySelector()` and, instead, use jQuery-style `$` shortcuts to specify elements.
- Refer to the last five DOM elements you selected on the **Elements** panel.
- Quickly refer to elements by their XPath, which you can copy in the **Element** panel.
- Query objects by their constructors.
- List just the keys or values of objects.
- Copy string representations of objects to clipboard.
- Get event listeners.
- Monitor events and function calls.

For a comprehensive list of all the Console Utilities API shortcuts, see the [Console Utilities API reference](/docs/devtools/console/utilities/).
