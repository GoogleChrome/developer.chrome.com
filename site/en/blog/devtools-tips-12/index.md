The Chrome DevTools **Animations** tab is a powerful tool that helps you slow down, replay, adjust CSS animation timings, and see the results right away.

The **Animations** tab, while open, records animations automatically, conveniently groups them, and lets you:

- Replay and slow down animations to better inspect them.
- Adjust durations, timings, and delays by dragging points in a timeline instead of guessing and setting CSS values manually.

Additionally, you can edit the easing timings and set custom `cubic-bezier` curve values with the **Easing Editor** in the **Elements** > **Styles** pane. To learn more, see [Edit animation and transition timings with the **Easing Editor**](/docs/devtools/css/reference/#edit-easing).

For a more hands-on learning experience, follow the [Inspect and modify CSS animation effects](/docs/devtools/css/animations/) guide.
