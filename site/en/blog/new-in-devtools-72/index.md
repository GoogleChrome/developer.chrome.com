New features and major changes coming to Chrome DevTools in Chrome 72 include:

- [Visualize performance metrics][1] in the Performance panel.
- [Highlight text nodes][2] in the DOM Tree.
- [Copy the JS path][3] to a DOM node from the DOM Tree.
- [Audits panel updates][4], including a new audit that detects JS libraries and new keywords for
  accessing the Audits panel from the Command Menu.

## Visualize performance metrics {: #metrics }

After [recording a page load][5], DevTools now marks performance metrics like `DOMContentLoaded` and
[First Meaningful Paint][6] in the **Timings** section.

## Highlight text nodes {: #highlight }

When you hover over a text node in the DOM Tree, DevTools now highlights that text node in the
viewport.

## Copy JS path {: #copy }

Suppose you're writing an automation test that involves clicking a node (using Puppeteer's
[`page.click()`][7] function, perhaps) and you want to quickly get a reference to that DOM node. The
usual workflow is to go to the Elements panel, right-click the node in the DOM Tree, select
**Copy** > **Copy selector**, and then pass that CSS selector to `document.querySelector()`. But if
the node is in a [Shadow DOM][8] this approach doesn't work because the selector yields a path from
within the shadow tree.

To quickly get a reference to a DOM node, right-click the DOM node and select **Copy** > **Copy JS
path**. DevTools copies to your clipboard a `document.querySelector()` expression that points to the
node. As mentioned above, this is particularly helpful when working with Shadow DOM, but you can use
it for any DOM node.

**Figure 3**. Copy JS path

DevTools copies an expression like the one below to your clipboard:

```js
document.querySelector('#demo1').shadowRoot.querySelector('p:nth-child(2)')
```

## Audits panel updates {: #audits }

The Audits panel is now running [Lighthouse 3.2][9]. Version 3.2 includes a new audit called
**Detected JavaScript libraries**. This audit lists out what JS libraries Lighthouse has detected on
the page. You can find this audit in your report under **Best Practices** > **Passed audits**.

Also, you can now access the Audits panel from the Command Menu by typing `Lighthouse` or `PWA`.
