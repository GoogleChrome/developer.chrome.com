**Episode 18:** by Veenita Joshi and Prakhar Asthana in
Mountain View, CA (February 2021)<br>
[Previous episodes](/tags/chromium-chronicle/)

**Test coverage measures how much source code is executed** when a particular
test suite runs. Generating coverage data has three major steps: compiling
with instrumentation, gathering data from running instrumented tests, and
post-processing the data. The coverage team has tools to automate this process.

The [Coverage script][1] **can generate code coverage reports in just one command**,
without waiting for [Gerrit UI to be updated](/blog/chromium-chronicle-3/).
This script is currently supported on Linux, Mac, iOS and ChromeOS.

Here is a sample usage:

```shell
$ gn gen out/coverage \
    --args='use_clang_coverage=true is_component_build=false'
$ python tools/code_coverage/coverage.py \
    crypto_unittests url_unittests \
    -b out/coverage -o out/report \
    -c 'out/coverage/crypto_unittests' \
    -c 'out/coverage/url_unittests --gtest_filter=URLParser.PathURL' \
    -f url/ -f crypto/
```

This builds and runs the `crypto_unittests` and `url_unittests targets`. For
`url_unittests`, it only runs the test `URLParser.PathURL`. The coverage
report is filtered to include only files and sub-directories under `url/`
and `crypto/`. Aside from automating the process, **this script provides
additional features to view code coverage by directories and components**.

The [Code Coverage tool][2] provides a code coverage breakdown by directory
and component for the whole codebase, for Windows, iOS, Android, Linux and
ChromeOS.
