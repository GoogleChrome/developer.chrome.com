Here's what you need to know:

* Use the [Document Picture in Picture API](#document-picture-in-picture) to increase user productivity.
* It is now easier to [debug missing stylesheets](#missing-stylesheets-debug) in DevTools
* And there’s plenty [more](#more).

I’m Adriana Jara. Let’s dive in and see what’s new for developers in Chrome 116.

## Document Picture-in-Picture API. {: #document-picture-in-picture}

The Document Picture-in-Picture API makes it possible to open an always-on-top window that can be populated with arbitrary HTML content.

<figure>

  <figcaption>A Picture-in-Picture window created with the Document Picture-in-Picture API (<a href="https://document-picture-in-picture-api.glitch.me/">demo</a>).</figcaption>
</figure>

The Picture-in-Picture window in the Document Picture-in-Picture API is similar to a blank same-origin window opened using `window.open()`, with some differences:

* The Picture-in-Picture window floats on top of other windows.
* The Picture-in-Picture window never outlives the opening window.
* The Picture-in-Picture window cannot be navigated.
* The Picture-in-Picture window position cannot be set by the website.

The following HTML sets up a custom video player and a button element to open the video player in a Picture-in-Picture window.

```html
<div id="playerContainer">
  <div id="player">
    <video id="video"></video>
  </div>
</div>
<button id="pipButton">Open Picture-in-Picture window</button>
```
The following JavaScript calls `documentPictureInPicture.requestWindow()` when the user clicks the button to open a blank Picture-in-Picture window. The returned promise resolves with a Picture-in-Picture window JavaScript object. The video player is moved to that window using `append()`.

```js
pipButton.addEventListener('click', async () => {
  const player = document.querySelector("#player");

  // Open a Picture-in-Picture window.
  const pipWindow = await documentPictureInPicture.requestWindow();

  // Move the player to the Picture-in-Picture window.
  pipWindow.document.body.append(player);
});
```

Check out [Picture-in-picture for any element](/docs/web-platform/document-picture-in-picture/)  for more details and examples.

## DevTools missing stylesheets debugging improvements. {: #missing-stylesheets-debug }

DevTools got a number of improvements to identify and debug issues with missing stylesheets.

First: the **Sources > Page** tree now shows only the successfully deployed and loaded stylesheets to minimize confusion.

Also the **Sources > Editor** now underlines and shows inline error tooltips next to failed, `@import`,`url()`, and `href` statements.

- The **Console**, in addition to links to failed requests, now provides links to the exact line that references a stylesheet that failed to load.

The **Network panel** consistently populates the **Initiator** column with links to the exact line that references a stylesheet that failed to load.

The **Issues panel** lists all stylesheets loading issues, including broken URLs, failed requests, and misplaced `@import` statements.

## And more! {: #more }

Of course there’s plenty more.

* [Motion path](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_motion_path) allows authors to position any graphical object and animate it along a path specified by the developer.
* The `display` and `content-visibility` properties are now supported in keyframe animations, which allows exit animations to be added purely in CSS.
* The fetch API can now be used with [Bring Your Own Buffer readers](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/ReadableStreamBYOBReader), reducing garbage collection overhead and copies, and improving responsiveness for users.

{% Aside 'update' %}
A previous version of this post stated that the [Back/forward cache `notRestoredReasons` API](/docs/web-platform/bfcache-notrestoredreasons/) was included in Chrome 116 but this feature has been delayed until a future release.
