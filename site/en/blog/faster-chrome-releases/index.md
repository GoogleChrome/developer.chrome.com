Starting with Chrome 114, the Chrome team is reducing the time between the branch for a release, and the actual release to stable. The aim is to shorten the time it takes to launch, and reduce merges.

This will not change the release date for Chrome stable or [early stable](/blog/early-stable/). It will, however, align the beta release date across platforms. Before Chrome 114, the iOS release went to beta a week before the Desktop and Android releases.

The following table shows how this change affects the 114 release.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Stage</th>
      <th>Chrome 114 (Old)</th>
      <th>Chrome 114 (Revised)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Feature Freeze</td>
      <td>Thu, Apr 6</td>
      <td><strong>Tue, Apr 11</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Branch </td>
      <td>Thu, Apr 20</td>
      <td><strong>Tue, Apr 25</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Beta Promotion</td>
      <td>Thu, May 4</td>
      <td><strong>Wed, May 3</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Beta Promotion (iOS)</td>
      <td>Wed, Apr 26</td>
      <td><strong>Wed, May 3</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Stable Cut</td>
      <td>Tue, May 23</td>
      <td>Tue, May 23</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Stable Cut (iOS)</td>
      <td>Tue, May 16</td>
      <td><strong>Tue, May 23</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Early Stable Release</td>
      <td>Wed, May 24</td>
      <td>Wed, May 24</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Stable Release</td>
      <td>Tue, May 30</td>
      <td>Tue, May 30</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Note that Chrome 115 stable will be delayed for two weeks to accommodate the July release freeze, all dates after this have been adjusted to account for the two week delay.

You can keep track of upcoming releases on the [Chrome Status Roadmap](https://chromestatus.com/roadmap), and see the schedule in detail on the [Chromium Dashboard](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/schedule). We publish a post on this site for each [beta release](/tags/beta/), so you can keep track of upcoming changes to Chrome.
