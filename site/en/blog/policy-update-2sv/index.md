Over the years we've made a number of product and policy improvements to help ensure that people can
safely install extensions on the Chrome Web Store. As part of this work, we've updated best
practices, and named undesirable behaviors in key areas like security and trust. Today we're
updating our security requirements and further clarifying a few policies to keep the quality of
extensions high, and the experience for developers consistent:

## Deceptive installation tactics update

* Offering multiple extensions as part of the same installation flow isn't allowed. Similarly,
  extensions can't disruptively upsell other extensions or apps. Such behaviors violate our
  Deceptive Installation Tactics and Notification Abuse policies.

* The set of functionalities promised by extensions must be stated clearly and in a transparent
  manner. All principal and significant features of your extension must be clear to the user and not
  buried in unrelated text.

* The outcome of any user interaction should match the reasonable expectations that were set with
  the user.

* Requiring unrelated user action to access promised functionality is not allowed.

## Spam and repetitive content

* Multiple extensions with highly similar functionality, content, and user experiences are
  considered repetitive. If these extensions are each small in content volume, and provide the same
  single purpose, developers should create a single extension that aggregates all the content. For
  example, publishing multiple wallpaper extensions, when these would be better served as a single
  extension, is prohibited.

## Two step verification

* Developers are required to enable Two Step Verification for their Google Account in order to
  publish new extensions, or to update existing extensions.

Taken together, these policy clarifications help preserve the wide variety of extensions in the
Chrome Web Store &mdash; from productivity tools to shopping helpers &mdash; while also respecting
user choice and strengthening security. These policy clarifications will go into effect on August 2,
2021. After that date, developers will no longer be able to publish new or update existing
extensions without enabling Two Step Verification, and extensions in violation of these clarified
policies may be removed from the Chrome Web Store and disabled.

We're grateful to both users and developers for helping us make the Chrome Web Store a safe and
secure way to extend the browser. As always, we welcome your feedback.
