## Restart frame during debugging {: #restart-frame }

The **Restart frame** feature is back! You can re-run the preceding code when paused somewhere in a function. Previously, this feature was deprecated and removed in Chrome 92 due to stability issues.

In this [example](https://jec.fish/), the debugger initially paused at the breakpoint (line 343) near the end of the `toggleColorScheme` function. To restart the debugging from the beginning of the `toggleColorScheme` function, expand the **Call stack** section in the **Debugger** pane, right click on `toggleColorScheme` and select **Restart frame**.

## Slow replay options in the Recorder panel {: #recorder }

You can now replay user flows at a slower speed — slow, very slow, and extremely slow. These options let you better observe each step replay on screen.

[Open](/docs/devtools/recorder/#open) the **Recorder** panel and [start a new recording](/docs/devtools/recorder/#record). Once the recording is done, click on the **Replay** dropdown button. Select a speed to start a replay.

Chromium issue: [1306756](https://crbug.com/1306756)


## Build an extension for the Recorder panel {: #recorder-extension }

You can now build or install a Chrome extension to export replay scripts in your favorite format. See [Recorder extension API](/docs/extensions/reference/devtools_recorder/) documentation to learn how to build one.

To install a demo extension, follow [these steps](https://github.com/puppeteer/replay#create-a-chrome-extension-for-recorder-available-from-chrome-104-onwards) outlined in the documentation.

## Group files by Authored / Deployed in the Sources panel {: #authored-deployed }

Enable the new **Group files by Authored / Deployed** option to organize your files in the Sources panel. When developing web applications with frameworks (for example, React, Angular), it can be difficult to navigate the source files due to the minified files generated by the build tools (for example, Webpack, Vite).

With this checkbox, you can group files into 2 categories for quicker file search:

- **Authored**. Similar to the source files you view in your IDE. DevTools generates these files based on source maps (provided by your build tools).
- **Deployed**. The actual files that the browser reads. Usually these files are minified.

Try it yourself with this [React demo](https://reactjs.org/)!

## New User Timings track in the Performance insights panel {: #performance }

Visualize `performance.measure()` marks in your recording with the new **User Timings** track in the **Performance insights** panel.

For example, this [web page](https://jec.fish/demo/perf-measure) uses the [`performance.measure()`](https://web.dev/usertiming/#calculating-measurements-with-measure()) method to calculate the elapsed time of text loading.

When you start [measuring the page load](/docs/devtools/performance-insights/#record), the **User Timings** track shows in the recording. Click on the timings item to view its details on the side pane.

## Reveal assigned slot of an element {: #slot }

Slotted elements in the **Elements** panel have a new `slot` badge. When debugging layout issues, use this feature to identify the element which affects the node's layout quicker.

This [example](https://mdn.github.io/web-components-examples/slotted-pseudo-element/) contains cards with a few named slots. Inspect the `person-occupation` slot of a card, click the `slot` badge next to it to reveal its assigned slot.

[Learn](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_templates_and_slots) how to use [<template>](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template) and [<slot>](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/slot) elements to create a flexible template that can then be used to populate the shadow DOM of a web component.

## Simulate hardware concurrency for Performance recordings {: #simulate }

The new **Hardware concurrency** setting in the **Performance** panel allows developers to configure the value reported by `navigator.hardwareConcurrency`.

Some applications use `navigator.hardwareConcurrency` to control the degree of parallelism of their application, for example, to control Emscripten pthread pool size. With this feature, developers can test their application performance with different core counts.

## Preview non-color value when autocompleting CSS variables {: #css-var }

When autocompleting CSS variables, DevTools now populates the non-color variable with a meaningful value so that you can preview what kind of change the value will have on the node.

## Identify blocking frames in the Back/forward cache pane {: #bfcache }

The [Back/forward cache](/docs/devtools/application/back-forward-cache/) pane in the **Application** panel has new **frames** section to help you identify blocking frames that may be preventing the page from being eligible for bfcache.

## Improved autocomplete suggestions for JavaScript objects {: #autocomplete }

The autocompletion for JavaScript object properties now display based on this order:

1. Own enumerable properties
2. Own non-enumerable properties
3. Inherited enumerable properties
4. Inherited non-enumerable properties

Previously, developers found it harder to find relevant properties because the suggestion only favored own properties over inherited properties, and all inherited properties were given equal priority.

## Source maps improvements {: #sourcemaps }

Here are a few fixes on source maps to improve the overall debugging experience:

- Breakpoints now work in inline `<script>` with sourceURL annotations.
- The debugger now resolves block scoped variables in the **Scope** view with source maps.

- The debugger now resolves variables in arrow functions in the **Scope** view with source maps.

## Miscellaneous highlights {: #misc }

These are some noteworthy fixes in this release:

- Fixed the **Auto-completion** setting for the **Sources** panel. Previously, the auto-complete always on even the setting is disabled. ([1323286](https://crbug.com/1323286))
- Updated the **Manifest** tab in the **Application** panel to parse the latest color scheme format. ([1318305](https://crbug.com/1318305))
- Improved the suggestions for the `<script async>` rendering blocking issues in the **Performance insights** panel. Previously,  DevTools suggested to `add async attribute to the script tag` even though the script is already marked as async. ([1334096](https://crbug.com/1334096))
- The **Performance insights** panel now detects iframes as potential causes for layout shifts. You can view the iframe details in the **Details** pane. ([1328873](https://crbug.com/1328873))
- When [open file](/docs/devtools/resources/#open) in the **Command menu**, the authored files (files generated by source maps) are now ranked higher so they appear above similarly named deployed scripts. ([1312929](https://crbug.com/1312929))
