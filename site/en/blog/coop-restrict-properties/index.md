A new value for
[Cross-Origin Opener Policy (COOP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy)
is available: `restrict-properties`. It brings in security benefits and makes
it easier to adopt [cross-origin isolation](https://web.dev/articles/coop-coep) while
allowing your site to interact with third-party popups for payments,
authentication, or other use cases.

To start experimenting with `restrict-properties` participate in the [origin
trial](#origin-trial) starting in [Chrome 116](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/schedule).

## Why use `restrict-properties`

`restrict-properties` has two main use cases:

- Preventing [cross-site leaks](https://xsleaks.dev/) without breakage.
- Making your site [cross-origin isolated](https://web.dev/articles/why-coop-coep).

### Prevent cross-site leaks without breakage

By default, any website can open your application in a popup and get a
reference to it.

A malicious website can use this to their advantage to perform attacks such as
[cross-site leaks](https://xsleaks.dev/).
To mitigate this risk, you can use the `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` (COOP) header.

Up until now, your options for `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` were limited. You
could either:
* Set `same-origin,` which blocks all cross-origin interactions with popups.
* Set `same-origin-allow-popups`, which blocks all cross-origin interactions
that open your site in a popup.
* Set `unsafe-none`, which allows all cross-origin interactions with popups.

This made it impossible for websites that need to be opened in a popup and to
interact with their opener to enforce COOP. This left key use cases like single
sign-on and payments unprotected from cross-site leaks.

`Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: restrict-properties` solves this.

With `restrict-properties`, properties that can be used for frame counting and
other cross-site leaks attacks are not availableâ€”but basic communication between
windows via `postMessage` and `closed` is allowed.

This improves a site's security while maintaining key use cases. For example:
* If you provide a service in a popup, setting `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy:
restrict-properties` will protect yourself against a range of cross-site leaks attacks.
You can still open all pages that you could previously open.
* If you need to access a cross-origin popup, setting
`Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: restrict-properties` will similarly protect
your site from iframe counting. You will be able to open the same set of
popups that you can open today.
* If both the opener and openee set the header, and the pages are cross-origin, it behaves similarly
to one of them having set the header. If they are same-origin, full access is
granted.

### Make your site cross-origin isolated

#### Why we need cross-origin isolation

Some web APIs increase the risk of side-channel attacks like
[Spectre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)). To
mitigate that risk, browsers offer an opt-in-based isolated environment called
[cross-origin isolation](https://web.dev/articles/coop-coep). With a cross-origin
isolated state, the webpage can use privileged features including
[SharedArrayBuffer](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer),
[performance.measureUserAgentSpecificMemory()](https://web.dev/articles/monitor-total-page-memory-usage)
and
[high-precision timers](/blog/cross-origin-isolated-hr-timers/)
with better resolution, while isolating the origin from others unless they are
opted in.

Up until now, to use these APIs, you had to set `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy:
same-origin`. However, this would break any cross-origin popup flow you might
need, such as single sign-on and Payments.

`Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: restrict-properties` can now be used instead of
`Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` to enable cross-origin isolation.
Instead of severing the opener relationship, it merely restricts it to the
minimal communication subset of `window.postMessage()` and `window.closed`.

You will be able to enable cross-origin isolation with the following two
headers:

```http
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: restrict-properties
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

or

```http
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: restrict-properties
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: credentialless
```

## Browser support

`Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: restrict-properties` is currently only supported
in Chrome. Other browsers are
[actively engaged in the discussion for standardization](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/6364).

## FAQ

### My website needs to communicate with same-origin popups, should I use `COOP: restrict-properties` to enable cross-origin isolation?

Setting `COOP: restrict-properties` on both the popup and your main page will
not cause restrictions. Setting it either only on the popup or only on the main
page will prevent any access to properties other than `postMessage` and `closed`
across the opener, even if they are same-origin.

### Is the set of allowed properties fixed?
Based on the feedback so far, `window.postMessage` and `window.closed` are suspected
to be enough for the majority of workflows, but we're still
considering opening it to other properties. If you have a use case that cannot
be solved using only `postMessage` and `closed` leave your feedback
[on the Intent to Experiment thread](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/JBTWXSHE8M0/m/fP4eXvFzAAAJ).
