The Chrome team has been working hard to build new capabilities, though we're
responsible for only a small fraction of the work. Web app developers depend
on countless others in the community to build a strong ecosystem of APIs, tools,
demonstration apps, and other materials. That's why earlier this year, we
announced the [Advanced Web Apps Fund][awa-fund-post].

We've sponsored 11 projects, distributing more than $100k through the
[Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/chrome/projects/advanced-apps-fund),
to recognize the importance of these projects and enable their creators to
spend time on them. These projects include:

* [Espruino Web IDE](https://www.espruino.com/): makes coding Espruino boards
  as easy as opening a web browser.
* [iPlug2](https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2): a free open source framework
  for making audio plugins with minimal code.
* [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/): open source realtime backend with
  embedded database, real time subscriptions, authentication, file storage and
  more.
* [PolygonJS](https://polygonjs.com/): create amazing and interactive 3D scenes
  for the web.
* [PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com/): created to help web developers build
  applications that work as well offline as they do online.
* [PWA Asset Generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pwa-asset-generator):
  quickly and easily generate assets for PWAs according to Web App Manifest
  specs and Apple Human Interface guidelines.
* [PWA Fire](https://pwafire.org/): a resource for PWA developers with
  documentation, tools, and VS Code extensions to help simplify PWA development.
* [SWSR](https://dev.to/thepassle/service-worker-side-rendering-swsr-cb1):
  investigating rendering in service workers.
* [URLPattern Polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/urlpattern-polyfill): a
  polyfill for the URLPattern API so that the feature is available in browsers
  that don't support it natively.
* [vite-plugin-pwa](https://github.com/antfu/vite-plugin-pwa): a zero-config
  and framework-agnostic PWA Plugin for Vite.
* [Wonder](https://theimmersiveweb.com/): all-in-one ecosystem for bringing
  Unreal Engine apps to HTML5, at near-native performance and lightning fast
  load times.

We're not done, and applications for new projects are still open. If you're
interested in submitting ideas for our next round, check out the
[Advanced Web Apps Fund announcement][awa-fund-post]. Then, submit your ideas
via our [submission form](https://forms.gle/GnTuCvDW3YhzSnBQ8).

As a reminder, we recently also expanded Chrome's sponsorship efforts to
include a new [CSS & UI Fund](https://web.dev/ui-fund/) and the
[Web Frameworks and Tools Performance Fund](https://blog.opencollective.com/chromes-framework-of-open-source-investment/).
If you are interested in submitting sponsorship requests to these efforts,
they are still open to reviewing entries.

Thank you to the projects and developers receiving sponsorship for the great
work you've done to move the web forward and help the ecosystem build a more
capable web!
