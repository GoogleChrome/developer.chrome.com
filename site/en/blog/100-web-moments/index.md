Google Chrome launched in 2018, and in March 2022 we are celebrating the launch of Chrome version 100 with a walk down memory lane. [#100CoolWebMoments](/100) remembers some cool, fun, interesting, and important things that have happened in the past 14 years.

A lot has happened on the web since 2018. If you read Ethan Marcotteâ€™s 2010 A List Apart article on [responsive web design](https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/) on the day of publication you might have done so with Chrome 4. By the time [Media Queries became a W3C Recommendation](https://www.css3.info/css3-media-queries-becomes-official-w3c-recommendation-css4-media-queries-takes-shape/) in 2012, Chrome 19 was available.

Chrome was at version 43 when Alex Russell introduced [Progressive Web Apps](https://infrequently.org/2015/06/progressive-apps-escaping-tabs-without-losing-our-soul/) in 2015, with [Microsoft announcing Edge as the new browser](https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/29/8511169/microsoft-edge-official-name-internet-explorer-upgrade) to replace Internet Explorer in the same year. 

In March 2017, version 57 brought us CSS Grid, the layout method was shipped in [Chrome, Firefox, and Safari](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2017/03/07/css-grid-lands-in-firefox-52/) within days of each other. This shared release of a major feature happened again more recently, with [Cascade Layers](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/cascade-layers/) landing in Chrome 99, along with Firefox 97, and Safari 15.4.
