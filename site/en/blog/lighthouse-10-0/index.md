[Lighthouse is a website auditing tool](/docs/lighthouse/overview/) that helps developers with opportunities and diagnostics to improve the user experience of their sites.

Lighthouse 10 is available immediately on the [command line through npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lighthouse), in [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/), and in [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/). It will land in Chrome stable in Chrome 112.

## Scoring changes

The venerable [Time To Interactive (TTI)](https://web.dev/tti/) metric is being removed in Lighthouse 10, with its 10% score weight shifted to [Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)](https://web.dev/cls/), which will now account for 25% of the [overall performance score](/docs/lighthouse/performance/performance-scoring/#lighthouse-10). Ideally this change will increase focus on CLS for sites that still need fixes for unnecessary layout shifts.

We expect this to improve most pages' performance scores, since most pages tend to score better on CLS than TTI. In an analysis of 13 million page loads in the latest HTTP Archive run, 90% of those pages would see an improvement in their Lighthouse performance score, with 50% of them seeing a performance improvement of more than 5 points.

</figure>

If for some reason you still need the Lighthouse TTI value (in a CI assertion, for example), it's still available unchanged in the Lighthouse JSON output, just with score weight 0 and hidden in the HTML report. Any scripted access of the JSON value should continue to work without changes.

## New audits

Lighthouse 10 brings a brand new performance audit and a significant change to another.

### Back/forward cache {: #bfcache }

The [back/forward cache (bfcache)](https://web.dev/bfcache/) is one of the most powerful tools available for improving a page's performance for real users. Beyond the normal browser cache, a page loaded from the bfcache will restore page layout and execution state nearly instantly, largely skipping all page load activity and getting your page in front of your users immediately as they navigate backward and forward through their history.

There are a few ways that a page can prevent the browser from restoring a page from the bfcache, however. This new Lighthouse audit actually navigates away from the test page and back again to test if it's bfcache-able, and lists the reasons if it fails.

<figure>

</figure>

Take a look at the [bfcache audit's docs](/docs/lighthouse/performance/bf-cache/) for more information.

### Paste-preventing inputs

The old Best Practices audit "Allows users to paste into password fields" has been expanded to now check that pasting into any (non-readonly) input field will work. For most sites, preventing pasting is a net-negative user experience and prevents legitimate safety and accessibility workflows.

The new audit is now ["Allows users to paste into input fields" (`paste-preventing-inputs`)](/docs/lighthouse/best-practices/paste-preventing-inputs/).

## Node users

If you use Lighthouse as a Node library, there are a few programmatic breaking changes in this release you may need to account for. See the [10.0 changelog](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/releases/tag/v10.0.0) for full details.

Lighthouse 10 also ships with full TypeScript type declarations! Anything imported from `lighthouse` should now be typed, which should be particularly helpful if you're scripting [Lighthouse user flows](https://web.dev/lighthouse-user-flows/).

Try out the types and let us know if you run into any issues using them.

## Running Lighthouse {: #running-lighthouse }

Lighthouse is available in [Chrome DevTools](/docs/devtools/overview/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lighthouse) (as a Node module and a CLI tool), and as a browser extension (in [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/google-lighthouse/)). It also powers several Google services, including [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/).

To try the Lighthouse Node CLI, use the following commands:

```text
npm install -g lighthouse
lighthouse https://www.example.com --view
```
