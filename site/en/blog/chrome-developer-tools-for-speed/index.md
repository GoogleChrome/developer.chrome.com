I spoke at Velocity a little bit ago and talked about the Developer Tools in Chrome to improve the speed of your apps. I covered the Task Manager, `window.performance`, onerror event, `console.profile()`, `console.markTimeline()` (now called `console.timeStamp()`), Timeline view, [Chrome's Heap Profiler](https://developers.google.com//web/tools/chrome-devtools/memory-problems/allocation-profiler), and remote debugging. 9 minutes.
