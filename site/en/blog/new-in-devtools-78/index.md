## Multi-client support in the Audits panel {: #multiclient }

You can now use the **Audits** panel in combination with other DevTools features like [Request
Blocking][1] and [Local Overrides][2].

For example, suppose that your **Audits** panel report says that your page's performance score is 70
and one of your biggest performance opportunities is [eliminating render-blocking resources][3].

{% Img src="image/admin/o4iVZaYzQHnLmhY5mfvJ.png", alt="The initial Performance score is 70.", width="800", height="374" %}

Figure 2. The initial report says that 3 render-blocking scripts are an issue.

Now that the **Audits** panel can be used in combination with request blocking, you can quickly
measure how much the render-blocking scripts affect your load performance by first [blocking the
requests for the render-blocking scripts][4]:

Figure 3. Using the **Request Blocking** tab to block the problematic scripts.

And then auditing the page again:

Figure 4. The **Performance** score improved to 97 after blocking the problematic scripts.

You could alternatively use [Local Overrides][5] to add `async` attributes to each of the script
tags, but "we'll leave that as an exercise for the reader." Go to [Multi-client demo][6] to try it
out. Or check out [this tweet][7] for a video demonstration.

## Payment Handler debugging {: #payments }

The **Background Services** section of the **Application** panel now supports [Payment Handler][9]
events.

1.  Go the the **Application** panel.
2.  Open the **Payment Handler** pane.
3.  Click **Record**. DevTools records Payment Handler events for 3 days, even when DevTools is
    closed.

4.  Enable **Show events from other domains** if your Payment Handler events occur on a different
    origin.
5.  After triggering a Payment Handler event, click the event's row to learn more about the event.

## Lighthouse 5.2 in the Audits panel {: #audits }

{% Aside %}

**Note:** This actually launched in Chrome 77, but we missed it in the last release notes so we're
covering it now.

{% endAside %}

The **Audits** panel is now running [Lighthouse 5.2][11]. The new **Third-Party Usage** diagnostic
audit tells you how much third-party code was requested and how long that third-party code blocked
the main thread while the page loaded. See [Optimize your third-party resources][12] to learn more
about how third-party code can degrade load performance.

[Chromium issue #772558][13]

## Largest Contentful Paint in the Performance panel {: #LCP }

When [analyzing load performance in the **Performance** panel][14], the **Timings** section now
includes a marker for [Largest Contentful Paint][15] (LCP). LCP reports the render time of the
largest content element visible in the viewport.

{% Img src="image/admin/YZcYowM2zmEuRXogL8FX.png", alt="The LCP marker in the Timings section.", width="800", height="620" %}

Figure 8. The **LCP** marker in the **Timings** section.

To highlight the DOM node associated with LCP:

1.  Click the **LCP** marker in the **Timings** section.
2.  Hover over the **Related Node** in the **Summary** tab to highlight the node in the viewport.

    {% Img src="image/admin/T2Aa5RiWuVWQONplTOSx.png", alt="The Related Node section of the Summary tab.", width="800", height="620" %}

    Figure 9. The **Related Node** section of the **Summary** tab.

3.  Click the **Related Node** to select it in the [**DOM Tree**][16].

## File DevTools issues from the Main Menu {: #issues }

If you ever encounter a bug in DevTools and want to file an issue, or if you ever get an idea on how
to improve DevTools and want to request a new feature, go to **Main Menu** > **Help** > **Report a
DevTools issue** to create an issue in the DevTools engineering team's tracker. Providing a
[minimal, reproducible example][17] on [Glitch][18] dramatically increases the team's ability to fix
your bug or implement your feature request!
