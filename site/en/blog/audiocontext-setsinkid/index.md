Until now, setting the destination audio output device was only possible for `<video>` and `<audio>` with `HTMLMediaElement.setSinkId()`. In [Web Audio], AudioContext used the default device, leaving the user to change the system audio output device manually.
 
From Chrome 110, you can use `AudioContext.setSinkId()` to programmatically direct the audio output in Web Audio to any permitted device. 

This is especially helpful in a variety of real-time communication scenarios. For example, a web app can use this to programmatically direct output to a specific audio output device such as a Bluetooth headset or speakerphone.

## Route audio output to a specific device

First, you need the identifier of the audio output device you want to use as a destination. Get the list of available media devices with `navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices()`, filter on audio output devices only, and get the `deviceId` attribute of the audio output device of your choice. The empty string `""` value can also be used as the default device for `deviceId`.

{% Aside %}
The list of media devices is exhaustive when the `"microphone"` permission is granted by the user. The list consists of default devices only when this permission is not granted. You can request this permission by calling `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true })`.
{% endAside %}

Once you have the identifier of the audio output device, create an `AudioContext` and call `audioContext.setSinkId(deviceId)`. On success, the returned promise resolves when the audio is routed to the chosen connected output device. It can fail if the AudioContext is closed.

The example below shows you how to request microphone access if needed and direct the audio output in Web Audio to the first available output device.

```js
const permission = await navigator.permissions.query({ name: "microphone" });
if (permission.state == "prompt") {
  // More audio outputs are available when user grants access to the mic.
  await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true });
}

// Request a list of media devices and filter audio output devices.
const devices = await navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices();
const audioOutputs = devices.filter(device => device.kind == "audiooutput");

const audioContext = new AudioContext();

// Pick the first available audio output.
const deviceId = audioOutputs[0].deviceId;
await audioContext.setSinkId(deviceId);
```

Note that you can also pass the `deviceId` as a `sinkId` parameter when creating an `AudioContext`.

```js
const audioContext = new AudioContext({ sinkId: deviceId });
```

## Render audio with a muted AudioContext

You can now specify a "silent output device" in Web Audio to minimize the power consumption. This time, instead of a string value, pass `{ type: "none" }` to `AudioContext.setSinkId()`.

Note that the audio clock accessible through `audioContext.currentTime` will still advance to render the audio graph. The main goal of this muted AudioContext is to render the audio graph without producing audible sound. The primary use case would be analyzing microphone input without making sounds.

```js
// Silent Web Audio output.
await audioContext.setSinkId({ type: "none" });
```

## Feature detection

To check if `AudioContext.setSinkId()` is supported, use:

```js
if ("setSinkId" in AudioContext.prototype) {
  // AudioContext.setSinkId() is supported.
}
```

## Sample

A demo is available at [https://sinkid.glitch.me/][demo] to play with `AudioContext.setSinkId()`. 

## Browser support

`AudioContext.setSinkId()` is available in Chrome&nbsp;110 or later.
