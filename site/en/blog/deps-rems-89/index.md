Chrome 89 beta was released on January 28, 2021 and is expected to become the
stable version in the first week of March 2021.

## Remove prefixed events for <link rel=prerender>

The legacy prefixed events (webkitprerenderstart, webkitprerenderstop,
webkitprerenderload, and webkitprerenderdomcontentloaded) dispatched on `<link
rel=prerender>` are now removed from Chrome.

## Stop cloning sessionStorage for windows opened with noopener

When a window is opened with noopener, Chrome will no longer clone the
sessionStorage of its opener; it will instead start an empty sessionStorage
namespace. This brings Chrome in conformance with the HTML specification.
