**Episode 6:** by Tiffany in San Francisco, CA (September, 2019)<br>
[Previous episodes](/tags/chromium-chronicle/)

Chrome's issue tracker, [Monorail][monorail-homepage], offers a grid view
that allows you to **visualize your issues in a Kanban style board**.
When you're viewing a list of issues, you can click the "Grid" button to
activate grid mode!

While on the grid page, you can customize your view to **sort issues by
almost any field you want**! Status, Priority, NextAction, Milestone,
Owner, you name it!

The flexibility of the grid view allows you to **customize it to fit your
team's needs**. For example, below we've set up the grid view to show all
pending Q3 Monorail work, sorted by owner and sprint date.

If you need more information on each issue, you can view the grid view with
"Tile" cells instead. And if you want a bird's eye view of many, many issues,
you can **view issues in the grid view as counts**. In fact, the grid view even
supports loading up to 6,000 issues at once.

All setting changes in the grid view are reflected in the page URL. So once
you've configured your grid to your needs, you can **share a link to your new
view with your team**. If you want, you could even use the grid view for your
weekly team status meetings.

As you use Monorail's grid view, please [file feedback][file-feedback]! We'd
love to hear your suggestions on how we can make the grid view better.
