Breakpoints let you pause your code in the middle of its execution, on an optional condition, and examine all values at that moment in time. Logpoints let you log messages to the **Console** without pausing the execution. Breakpoints and logpoints are an efficient alternative to `debugger;` statements and `console.log()` calls in your code.

Watch the video to learn how to use breakpoints and logpoints to debug your code:

- Set a breakpoint with a click.
- View the **Call Stack**, inspect variables, and edit their values in **Scope** and the **Console**.
- Right-click > **Ignore** third-party scripts.
- Disable pausing on `debugger;` statements.
- Add a condition to pause on.
- Log values to the **Console** without pausing.
- Set the **Debugger** to pause on caught or uncaught exceptions.

To learn more about breakpoint types, see [Pause your code with breakpoints](/docs/devtools/javascript/breakpoints/).
