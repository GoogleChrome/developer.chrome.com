## Debugging support for Trusted Types violations {: #trusted-types }

### Breakpoint on Trusted Type violations {: #trusted-types-violations }

You can now set breakpoints and catch exceptions on Trusted Type Violations in the **Sources**
panel.

[Trusted Types][2] API helps you prevent DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. Learn how
to write, review and maintain applications free of DOM XSS vulnerabilities with Trusted Types
[here][3].

In the **Sources** panel, open the **debugger** sidebar pane. Expand the **CSP Violation
Breakpoints** section and enable the **Trusted Type violations** checkbox to pause on the
exceptions. Try it yourself with [this demo page][4].

Chromium issue: [1142804][5]

### Link issue in the Sources panel to the Issues tab {: #trusted-type-link }

The **Sources** panel now shows a warning icon next to the line that violates Trusted Type. Hover on
it to preview the exception. Click on it to expand the **Issues** tab, it provides more details on
the exceptions and guidance on how to fix it.

the screenshot was cut off for content not visible in the viewport. The full-page screenshots are
precise now as well.

In the **Elements** panel, right click on an element and select **Capture node screenshot**.

{% Img src="image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/0BdfMKAxWPSImRe0mkkA.png", alt="Capture node screenshot beyond viewport", width="800", height="486" %}

Chromium issue: [1003629][7]

## New Trust Tokens tab for network requests {: #trust-token }

Inspect the Trust Token network requests with the new **Trust Tokens** tab.

Trust Token is a new API to help combat fraud and distinguish bots from real humans, without passive
tracking. Learn how to [get started with Trust Tokens][8].

Further debugging support will come in the next releases.

Chromium issue: [1126824][9]

## Lighthouse 7 in the Lighthouse panel {: #lighthouse }

The **Lighthouse** panel is now running Lighthouse 7. Check out the [release notes][10] for a full
list of changes.

{% Img src="image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/O2w1DjKGBOzjBx1gVZ2N.png", alt="Lighthouse 7 in the Lighthouse panel", width="800", height="535" %}

New audits in Lighthouse 7:

- **Preload Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) image**. Audits if the image used by the LCP element is
  preloaded in order to improve your LCP time.
- **Issues logged to the `Issues` panel**. Indicates a list of unresolved issues in the `Issues`
  panel.
- **Progressive Web Apps (PWA)**. The PWA Category changed fairly significantly.
- The **Installable** group is now powered entirely by the capability checks that enable Chrome's
  installable criteria. These are the same signals seen in the **Manifest pane**.

  - The "Registers a service worker…" audit moves to the **PWA Optimized** group, and the "Uses
    HTTPS" audit is now included as part of the key "installability requirements" audit.
  - The **Fast and reliable** group is removed. As the revamped "installability requirements" audit
    includes offline-capability checking, the "current page and start_url respond with 200 when
    offline" audit was removed. The "Page load is fast enough on mobile network" audit was removed
    too.

Chromium issue: [772558][11]

## Elements panel updates {: #elements-panel }

## Experimental features {: #experimental_features }

### Automate browser testing with Puppeteer Recorder {: #record }

{% Aside %}

To enable the experiment, check the **Recorder** checkbox under **Settings** > **Experiments**.

{% endAside %}

DevTools can now generate [Puppeteer][37] scripts based on your interaction with the browser, making
it easier for you to automate browser testing. Puppeteer is a Node.js library which provides a
high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium over the [DevTools Protocol][38].

Go to [this demo page][39]. Open the **Sources** panel in DevTools. Select the **Recording** tab on
the left pane. Add a new recording and name the file (e.g. test01.js).

Click on the **Record** button at the bottom to start recording the interaction. Try to fill in the
on-screen form. Observe that Puppeteer commands are appended to the file accordingly. Click on the
**Record** button again to stop the recording.

To run the script, follow the [Getting started guide][40] in Puppeteer official site.

Please note that this is an early-stage experiment. We plan to improve and expand the Recorder
functionality over time.

{% Aside %}

To enable the experiment, check the **Enable CSS Flexbox debugging features** checkbox under
**Settings** > **Experiments**.

{% endAside %}

DevTools added experimental support for [flexbox debugging since last release][43].

DevTools now draws a guiding line to help you better visualize the CSS `align-items` property. The
CSS `gap` property is supported as well. In our example here, we have CSS `gap: 12px;`. Notice the
hatching pattern for each gap.

{% Img src="image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/brHBni7Gr96jMSjRc1mb.png", alt="Flexbox", width="800", height="671" %}

Chromium issue: [1139949][44]

### New CSP Violations tab {: #csp }

{% Aside %}

To enable the experiment, check the **Show CSP Violations view** checkbox under **Settings** >
**Experiments**.

{% endAside %}

This new tab is an experiment that should make it easier to work with web pages with a large amount
of CSP and Trusted Type violations.

{% Img src="image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/xmTnAFhWeCA9FryrRbpa.png", alt="CSP Violations tab", width="800", height="517" %}

Chromium issue: [1137837][45]

### New color contrast calculation - Advanced Perceptual Contrast Algorithm (APCA) {: #apca }

{% Aside %}

To enable the experiment, check the **Enable new Advanced Perceptual Contrast Algorithm (APCA)
replacing previous contrast ratio and AA/AAA guidelines** checkbox under **Settings** >
**Experiments**.

{% endAside %}

The [Advanced Perceptual Contrast Algorithm (APCA)][46] is replacing the [AA][47]/[AAA][48]
guidelines contrast ratio in the [Color Picker][49].

APCA is a new way to compute contrast based on modern research on color perception. Compared to
AA/AAA guidelines, APCA is more context-dependent. The contrast is calculated based on the text's
spatial properties (font weight & size), color (perceived lightness difference between text and
background), and context (ambient light, surroundings, intended purpose of the text).

{% Img src="image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/hjvKOnOw41pDjkOsyW1E.png", alt="APCA in Color Picker", width="800", height="543" %}
