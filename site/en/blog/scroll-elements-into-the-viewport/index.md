If an element you're inspecting is out of view, bring it into the viewport:

- Right click on the DOM node from the elements panel.
- Select Scroll into view.

Also, you probably see this all the time but don't forget, when you hover over a DOM node, a small tooltip appears indicating the dimensions and position of the element in question.
