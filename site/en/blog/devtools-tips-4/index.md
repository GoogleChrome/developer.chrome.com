The **Recorder** panel lets you record, replay, share, and measure user flows on your website. Watch the video to see it in action.

For a more hands-on experience, see the [Record, replay, and measure user flows](/docs/devtools/recorder/) tutorial.

The DevTools team is actively developing the **Recorder** panel and has added the following new capabilities since the video came out. Now you can:

- [Export and share your recordings](/docs/devtools/recorder/reference/#export-flows) in various formats, including custom ones.
- [Slow down the replay](/docs/devtools/recorder/reference/#slow-down-the-replay) and debug during the recording:
  - [Inspect the code of the recording](/docs/devtools/recorder/reference/#inspect-code).
  - [Set breakpoints and execute step by step](/docs/devtools/recorder/reference/#breakpoints-and-step-through).
  - [Edit steps](/docs/devtools/recorder/reference/#edit-steps) both during the recording and after.
- Install [extensions](/docs/devtools/recorder/extensions/) to expand the **Recorder** capabilities.
- Customize the **Recorder** by [building an extension](/docs/devtools/recorder/extensions/#build-extension) yourself.
