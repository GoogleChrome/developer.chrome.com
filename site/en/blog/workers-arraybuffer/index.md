As of [crbug.com/73313](https://crbug.com/73313), Chrome 13 and FF5 support sending an `ArrayBuffer` (or Typed Array) to/from a Web Worker. For example:

## worker.js 


```js
self.onmessage = function(e) {
    var uInt8Array = e.data;
    postMessage("Inside worker.js: uInt8Array.toString() = " + uInt8Array.toString());
    postMessage("Inside worker.js: uInt8Array.byteLength = " + uInt8Array.byteLength);
};
```

## main.html


```js
var uInt8Array = new Uint8Array(new ArrayBuffer(10));
for (var i = 0; i < uInt8Array.length; ++i) {
    uInt8Array[i] = i * 2; // [0, 2, 4, 6, 8,...]
}

console.log('uInt8Array.toString() = ' + uInt8Array.toString());
console.log('uInt8Array.byteLength = ' + uInt8Array.byteLength);

worker.postMessage(uInt8Array);
```


Why is this exciting?...binary data!

Instead of the browser serializing your `postMessage()` data to a JSON object, it uses the [structured clone algorithm](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm) to copy the `ArrayBuffer` to the worker's context, and vice versa. This opens up a real potential for workers that we haven't seen before. That is, being able to easily pass binary data between main app and worker thread.

Typed array I/O makes intense image manipulation, sound processing, and heavy WebGL calculations much more feasible. For example, one could [read a File as an array buffer](https://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/file/dndfiles/#toc-reading-files) or [fetch a Blob using XHR2](https://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/file/xhr2/#toc-reponseTypeArrayBuffer) and pass the result directly to a worker. No more base64 encoding the data :)

In my opinion this is one of those nitpicks workers should have included from the start. It just makes sense.
