## Metadata {: #metadata }

Web Platform documentation should follow the conventions outlined in the [Add a Doc][add-a-doc] guide. 

The `toc.yml` file is located at `site/_collections/_data/docs/web-platform/toc.yml`. 
Link your new doc in this file in the appropriate category. If your doc moves between Origin and Developer Trials, 
and when it ships, make a PR to update this file to move it in the list.

The following is a suggested outline when documenting a new Origin or Developer Trial. 
As the intention is for new web platform features to ultimately be documented over on [MDN][mdn], 
use the same conventions as described in the [MDN guide to writing API docs][mdn-guide] where possible. 

{% Aside %}
Once you have written your docs, or if there has been a big change to the feature, write a [quick blog post][blog] to let developers know. 
The blog post shouldnt repeat these docs, but could share the latest news, or demonstrate part of the feature with a tutorial, 
then link to the docs for all the details.
{% endAside %}

## Outline

```md

Intro paragraph explaining briefly what this API is for.

## Current status

Add information about status, and how developers can try out the API. 

## Use cases 

Change the heading above to make sense for your content, 
however here you can add a short explanation, 
and the core use cases for the API.

## Interfaces

Describe each interface that is part of the API 
using a description list format.

`interfaceName`
: Short description.

## Examples

Code snippets should be included here to show the basic use of the API. 

## Demo

If you have a demo hosted elsewhere, 
add a short description and link out to it.

## Feedback

How should developers offer feedback?

## Useful links

Include links to the spec, explainer, 
Chrome Status, MDN, and so on.
  
```

## Origin trials we are no longer persuing

If the origin trial is abandoned, then move the documentation to the section under `- title: i18n.docs.web-platform.not-persuing` in `toc.yml`. 
Then remove information about signing up for the trial from the documentation.
