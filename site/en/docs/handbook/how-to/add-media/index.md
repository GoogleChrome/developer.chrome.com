## Navigate to the media uploader

Visit [the image uploader page](https://chrome-gcs-uploader.web.app/) and
sign-in using your Google corporate account. Note that this page only allows
Googlers access, so signing in with a personal account will fail.

## Choose a file

- Click **Choose file** and select either an image or a video to upload.
- Click **Upload**

A button with a hashed image or video url will appear. It should look something
like this:

```md
{% raw %}{% img src="image/foR0vJZKULb5AGJExlazy1xYDgI2/1603484068246.jpg", alt="ALT TEXT HERE" %}{% endraw %}
```

- Click the button to copy the snippet to your clipboard ðŸ“‹

## Paste!

Paste the copied code from the previous step into your article.

Be sure to replace the text that says "ALT TEXT HERE" with your own description
of the image. You can read more about writing effective alt text over on [the
web.dev handbook](https://web.dev/handbook/inclusion-and-accessibility/#use-inclusive-images).

!!!.aside
You may notice that the generated code is using either the
{% raw %}`{% img %}`{% endraw%} or {% raw %}`{% video %}`{% endraw%} shortcodes.
These are custom components for `developer.chrome.com` that ensure our media is
responsive ðŸ“±
!!!

### Adjusting dimensions

The `{% raw %}`{% img %}`{% endraw%}` shortcode accepts additional arguments for
`width` and `height`. If you want to set your image to have a width of 400 and
a height of 200, do the following:

```text
{% raw %}{% img src="image/foR0vJZKULb5AGJExlazy1xYDgI2/1603484068246.jpg", alt="ALT TEXT HERE", width="400", height="200" %}{% endraw %}
```

### Properties

The `{% raw %}`{% img %}`{% endraw%}` shortcode accepts many named arguments. Below are interfaces for both shortcodes. Each property of the interface is a named argument that can be used in the shortode.

#### Img Properties (`ImgArgs`)

```typescript
{% include '../../../../../../types/site/_shortcodes/img.d.ts' %}
```

#### Video Properties (`VideoArgs`)

```typescript
{% include '../../../../../../types/site/_shortcodes/video.d.ts' %}
```
