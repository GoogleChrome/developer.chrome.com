[HTTP Cookies][1] are mainly used to manage user sessions, store user personalization preferences,
and track user behavior. They are also the cause of all of those annoying "this page uses cookies"
consent forms that you see across the web. This guide teaches you how to view, edit, and delete a
page's cookies with Chrome DevTools.

## Open the Cookies pane {: #open }

1.  [Open Chrome DevTools][2].
2.  Click the **Application** tab to open the **Application** panel.
    Under **Storage** expand **Cookies**, then select an origin.

## Fields {: #fields }

The **Cookies** table contains the following fields:

- **Name**. The cookie's name.
- **Value**. The cookie's value.
- **Domain**. The hosts that are allowed to receive the cookie.
- **Path**. The URL that must exist in the requested URL in order to send the `Cookie` header.
- **Expires / Max-Age**. The cookie's expiration date or maximum age.
  For [session cookies][6] this value is always `Session`.
- **Size**. The cookie's size, in bytes.
- **HTTP**. If true, this field indicates that the cookie should only be used over HTTP, and
  JavaScript modification is not allowed.
- **Secure**. If true, this field indicates that the cookie can only be sent to the server over a
  secure, HTTPS connection.
- **SameSite**. Contains `strict` or `lax` if the cookie is using the experimental `SameSite`
  attribute.
- **SameParty**. If true, this field indicates that the cookie is allowed to be set or sent in contexts
  where all ancestor frames belong to the same [First-Party Set][3].
- **Priority**. Contains `low`, `medium` (default), or `high` if using deprecated [cookie
  Priority][10] attribute.

## Filter cookies {: #filter }

Use the **Filter** text box to filter cookies by **Name** or **Value**. Filtering by other fields is
not supported.
