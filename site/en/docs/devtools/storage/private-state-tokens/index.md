This guide shows you how to use [Chrome DevTools](/docs/devtools/) to inspect [Private State Token](/docs/privacy-sandbox/trust-tokens/)
data. The [Private State Token API](https://wicg.github.io/trust-token-api/) was previously known as the
[Trust Token API](/blog/rename-trust-tokens/). From the proposal [**explainer**](https://github.com/WICG/trust-token-api#overview):

<blockquote cite="https://github.com/WICG/trust-token-api/">
  <p>
    These tokens are non-personalized and cannot be used to track users, but are cryptographically signed so they cannot be forged.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Private State Tokens enable a website to convey a limited amount of information from one browsing context to another
(for example, across sites) to help combat fraud, without passive tracking.



## View Private State Token data

1. [Open DevTools](/docs/devtools/open/) > **Application** > **Storage**.

## Delete Private State Tokens
