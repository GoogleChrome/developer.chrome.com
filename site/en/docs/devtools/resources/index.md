This guide teaches you how to use Chrome DevTools to view a web page's resources. Resources are the
files that a page needs in order to display correctly. Examples of resources include CSS,
JavaScript, and HTML files, as well as images.

This guide assumes that you're familiar with the basics of [web development][1] and [Chrome
DevTools][2].

## Open resources {: #open }

When you know the name of the resource that you want to inspect, the **Command Menu** provides a
fast way of opening the resource.

1.  Press <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> or <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> (Mac). The **Open
    File** dialog opens.

2.  Select the file from the dropdown, or start typing the filename and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> once
    the correct file is highlighted in the autocomplete box.

### Reveal resources in the Network panel from other panels {: #reveal }

The [Browse resources][4] section below shows you how to view resources from various parts of the
DevTools UI. If you ever want to inspect a resource in the **Network** panel, right-click the
resource and select **Reveal in Network panel**.

## Browse resources {: #browse }

### Browse by directory {: #directory }

To view a page's resources organized by directory:

1.  Click the **Sources** tab to open the **Sources** panel.
2.  Click the **Page** tab to show the page's resources. The **Page** pane opens.

    {% Img src="image/admin/8RBI1gfYe2F9c0bwzecj.png", alt="The Page pane", width="800", height="569" %}

    **Figure 6**. The **Page** pane

    Here's a breakdown of the non-obvious items in **Figure 6**:

    - **top** is the main document [browsing context][6].
    - **airhorner.com** represents a domain. All resources nested under it come from that domain.
      For example, the full URL of the **comlink.global.js** file is probably
      `https://airhorner.com/scripts/comlink.global.js`.
    - **scripts** is a directory.
    - **(index)** is the main HTML document.
    - **iu3** is another browsing context. This context was probably created by an `<iframe>`
      element embedded in the main document HTML.
    - **sw.js** is a service worker execution context.

3.  Click a resource to view it in the **Editor**.

### Browse by filename {: #filename }

By default the **Page** pane groups resources by directory. To disable this grouping and view each
domain's resources as a flat list:

1.  Open the **Page** pane. See [Browse by directory][7].
2.  Click **More Options** {% Img src="image/admin/W3Y7nl0uwxmN3iDrJZNf.png", alt="More Options", width="6", height="26" %} and
    disable **Group By Folder**.

    **Figure 8**. The **Group By Folder** option

    Resources are organized by file type. Within each file type the resources are organized
    alphabetically.

### Browse by file type {: #type }

To group resources together based on their file type:

1.  Click the **Application** tab. The **Application** panel opens. By default the **Manifest** pane
    usually opens first.
