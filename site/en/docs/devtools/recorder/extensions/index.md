## Troubleshooting {: #extension-troubleshooting }

If you don't see export or replay options after installing an extension, check or do the following:

- The extension only works on web pages. For example, the export option is not available for `chrome://` pages like `chrome://extensions`.
- Always open a new browser tab after installing the extension.

Known issues:

- [Issue 1351416](https://crbug.com/1351416) in Chrome 104 and 105 prevents the display of the export option if you open the **Recorder** as the [first DevTools panel](/docs/devtools/open/#last). As a workaround, open another panel first (for example, **Console**), then open the **Recorder**. The issue is fixed in Chrome 106.

## Build your own extension {: #build-extension }

To further customize the **Recorder** to your needs, you can build your own extension:

1. Check out [Customize and automate user flows beyond Chrome DevTools Recorder](/blog/extend-recorder/).
1. Explore the [chrome.devtools.recorder](/docs/extensions/reference/devtools_recorder/) API.
1. Check out [example extensions](https://github.com/puppeteer/replay/tree/main/examples).
1. [Develop your extension](/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/) and publish it at [Chrome Web Store](/docs/webstore/about_webstore/).
1. Feel free to [add it to the list of extensions](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/developer.chrome.com/edit/main/site/en/docs/devtools/recorder/extensions/index.md) on this page.
