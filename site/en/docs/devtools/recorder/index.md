10. Click on the *Submit* button to complete the checkout process.
11. In the **Recorder** panel. Click **End recording** button to end the recording.


## Replay a user flow {: #replay }

After recording a user flow, you can replay it by clicking on the **Replay** button.

{% Video src="video/dPDCek3EhZgLQPGtEG3y0fTn4v82/0fLvDBSUaiEwL8kJG2Kx.mp4", autoplay="true", muted="true", loop="true", class="screenshot" %}

You can see the user flow replay on the page. The replay progress is shown in the **Recorder** panel as well.

You can simulate a slow network connection by configuring the **Replay settings**. For example, expand the **Replay settings**, select **Slow 3G** in the **Network** dropdown.
{% Img src="image/dPDCek3EhZgLQPGtEG3y0fTn4v82/SSoCLGi4xdaVHKO9D0ec.png", alt="replay settings", width="800", height="528" %}

More settings might be supported in the future. [Share with us](https://goo.gle/recorder-feedback) the replay settings you would like to have!


## Measure a user flow {: #measure }

You can measure the performance of a user flow by clicking on the **Measure performance** button. For example, checkout is a critical user flow of a shopping website. With the **Recorder** panel, you can record the checkout flow once and measure it regularly.

{% Video src="video/dPDCek3EhZgLQPGtEG3y0fTn4v82/RfznQY25Sut04RjOfAZQ.mp4", autoplay="true", muted="true", loop="true", class="screenshot" %}

Clicking on the **Measure performance** button will first trigger a replay of the user flow, then open the performance trace in the **Performance** panel.

Learn how to [analyze your page's runtime performance](/devtools/evaluate-performance/) with the **Performance** panel. You can enable the [Web Vitals checkbox](/blog/new-in-devtools-88/#web-vitals) in the **Performance** panel, to view the [Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals) metrics, identify opportunities to improve your user browsing experience.

## Edit user flows {: #edit-flows }

Let's walk through the options to edit the user flows.

{% Img src="image/dPDCek3EhZgLQPGtEG3y0fTn4v82/a3NDihdiqCd6YsirLEcw.png", alt="DevTools Recorder panel has a dropdown menu in the header which allows you to select a user flow to edit", width="800", height="560" %}

On the top of the **Recorder** panel, there are options for you to:

1. **Add a new recording**. Click on the **+** icon to [add a new recording](#record).
2. **View all recordings**. The dropdown shows the list of saved recordings. Select the **[number] recording(s)** option to expand and manage the list of saved recordings.
     {% Img src="image/dPDCek3EhZgLQPGtEG3y0fTn4v82/g3x137aFK4xJrsdqONKY.png", alt="View all recordings", width="800", height="560" %}
3. **Export a recording**. You can export the user flow as [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev) script to customize the script further.
4. **Delete a recording**. Delete the selected recording. 

## Edit steps {: #edit-steps }

Let's walk through the options to edit the steps within a workflow.

1. Expand each step to see the details of the action. For example, expand the *Click Element "Cappucino"* step.
  {% Img src="image/dPDCek3EhZgLQPGtEG3y0fTn4v82/ADbB4FFeiBBZqbxKRw0s.png", alt="In the recorder panel, the Cappucino element has been expanded to reveal type, target, selectors, offset X, and offset Y.", width="800", height="663" %}
2. The step above shows 2 **selectors**. The **Recorder** will automatically detect 2 selectors for most of the steps by default.
    - When replaying the user flow, the **Recorder** will try to query the element with one of the selectors by sequence.
    - For example, if the **Recorder** successfully queries the element with the first selector, it will skip the second selector and proceed to the next step.
3. You can add or remove any selectors. For example, you can remove the *selector #2* because just `aria/Cappucino` is sufficient in this case. Hover over the *selector #2* and click on **-** to remove it.
    {% Img src="image/dPDCek3EhZgLQPGtEG3y0fTn4v82/qEat3jT1Og68urhmSkef.png", alt="The DevTools recorder panel shows an option to remove a selector", width="800", height="663" %}
4. The **selector** is editable too. For example, if you want to select *Mocha* instead of *Cappucino*, you can edit the selector value to *aria/Mocha* instead.
  {% Img src="image/dPDCek3EhZgLQPGtEG3y0fTn4v82/OdihJ4BROOXZ93eidr4b.png", alt="edit a selector", width="800", height="663" %} 
5. [Replay](#replay) the flow now, it should select *Mocha* instead of *Cappucino*.
6. Try to edit other step properties such as **type**, **target**, **value** and more.

There are options to add and remove steps too. This is useful if you want to add an extra step or remove an accidentally added step. Instead of re-recording the user flow, you can just edit it. Click on the **3-dot** kebab menu next to the step to open the menu. 

{% Img src="image/dPDCek3EhZgLQPGtEG3y0fTn4v82/rs8gfXvOFh0Jrnw3F15j.png", alt="DevTools UI for coffee cart, including the menu for the Scroll event expanded to reveal three options: Add step before, add step after, and remove step.", width="800", height="663" %}

1. For example, the *Scroll* event after the *Mocha* step is not necessary. You can select **Remove step** to remove it.
2. Say you want to **wait until the 9 coffees** display on the page before performing any steps.
3. In the *Mocha* step menu, select **Add step before**.
    {% Img src="image/dPDCek3EhZgLQPGtEG3y0fTn4v82/jEOHv9iiVfqMQvKRbueR.png", alt="A new step named Assert Element was added and can now be edited", width="800", height="663" %} 
5. In *Assert Element*, edit the new step with the following details:
    - type: **waitForElement**
    - selector #1: **.cup**
    - operator: **==** (click **add operator** button)
    - count: **9** (click **add count** button)
   {% Img src="image/dPDCek3EhZgLQPGtEG3y0fTn4v82/zeK91O21jvc5OD9HuovR.png", alt="The new step for coffee checkout has been updated with the aforementioned details.", width="800", height="663" %}
6. [Replay](#replay) the flow now to see the changes.
