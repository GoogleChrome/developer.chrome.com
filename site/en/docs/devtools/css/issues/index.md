This guide assumes that you're familiar with inspecting CSS in Chrome DevTools. See [View and change CSS][1] to learn the basics.

## Inspect the CSS you author {: #styles }

Suppose that you added some CSS to an element and want to make sure the new styles are
applied properly. When you refresh the page, the element looks the same as before. Something is wrong.

The first thing to do is [inspect the element][2] and make sure that your new CSS is actually applied to the element.

Sometimes, you'll see your new CSS in the **Elements** > **Styles** pane but your new CSS is in pale text, non-editable, crossed out, or has a warning or hint icon next to it.

## Understand CSS issues {: #css-issues }

The **Styles** pane recognizes many kinds of CSS issues and highlights them in different ways.

### Invalid {: #invalid }

The **Styles** pane crosses out properties with invalid syntax and displays {% Img src="image/NJdAV9UgKuN8AhoaPBquL7giZQo1/hJxGejygnlBfMvhMtcCX.svg", alt="Warning.", width="24", height="24" %} warning icons next to them.

{% Img src="image/NJdAV9UgKuN8AhoaPBquL7giZQo1/HSQATBEOt6MholSjoji2.png", alt="Invalid CSS properties.", width="800", height="542" %}

### Overridden {: #overridden }

The **Styles** pane crosses out properties that are overridden by other properties according to the [Cascading order][3].

{% Video src="video/NJdAV9UgKuN8AhoaPBquL7giZQo1/BNlYQHj8tpojjxyMKNDv.mp4", autoplay=false, controls=true, loop=true, class="screenshot" %}

### Inactive {: #inactive }

The **Styles** pane crosses out properties that are valid but have no effect because of other properties. Such properties have {% Img src="image/NJdAV9UgKuN8AhoaPBquL7giZQo1/2OyGRodvgk9neTIEAH4g.svg", alt="Information.", width="24", height="24" %} information icons next to them and are inactive because of CSS logic, not the [Cascading order][3].

{% Aside 'gotchas' %}
Hover over the {% Img src="image/NJdAV9UgKuN8AhoaPBquL7giZQo1/2OyGRodvgk9neTIEAH4g.svg", alt="Information.", width="24", height="24" %} icon to get a hint at what went wrong.
{% endAside %}

{% Img src="image/NJdAV9UgKuN8AhoaPBquL7giZQo1/6ekURzFTurs4nzzgWfmx.png", alt="Inactive CSS declaration with a hint.", width="800", height="558" %}

### Inherited {: #inherited }

The **Styles** pane lists inherited properties in `Inherited from <element-name>` sections. Additionally, the **Styles** pane lists [non-inherited properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/inheritance) for completeness but in pale text.

{% Img src="image/NJdAV9UgKuN8AhoaPBquL7giZQo1/pkBcVUnT1QLxEZkhq9P9.png", alt="The Inherited from body section listing inherited and non-inherited CSS.", width="800", height="431" %}

### Shorthand {: #shorthand }

The **Styles** pane displays [shorthand properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Shorthand_properties) as {% Img src="image/NJdAV9UgKuN8AhoaPBquL7giZQo1/VPpFJAIWgNSaTmnYrqNP.svg", alt="Drop-down.", width="24", height="24" %} drop-down lists with all the properties that are shortened.

{% Img src="image/NJdAV9UgKuN8AhoaPBquL7giZQo1/vzJiWOkmE0WeeZoJtdah.png", alt="The shorthand property with a drop-down list.", width="800", height="597" %}

In the expanded list, you can't edit the shortened properties but you can find at a glance, for example, overridden shortened properties.

### Non-editable {: #non-editable}

The **Styles** pane displays properties that can't be edited in *italic text*. For example, the CSS from the following sources can't be edited:

- `user agent stylesheet`â€”Chrome's default stylesheet.

  {% Img src="image/NJdAV9UgKuN8AhoaPBquL7giZQo1/yhDE5n8UWyu2T2CwKGOZ.png", alt="The CSS from user agent stylesheet.", width="800", height="445" %}

- Style attributes on the element. You can edit them in the DOM tree and this updates the CSS in the **Styles** pane, but not the other way around.

  {% Video src="video/NJdAV9UgKuN8AhoaPBquL7giZQo1/TwzSI9igPEbgELGEyAzU.mp4", autoplay=false, controls=true, loop=true, class="screenshot" %}

## Inspect an element that still isn't styled the way you think  {: #computed }

Use the **Computed** tab to see the "final" [CSS applied to an element](/docs/devtools/css/reference/#computed).

The **Elements** > **Styles** pane displays the exact set of CSS rules exactly as they are written in various stylesheets. On the other hand, the **Elements** > **Computed** pane lists resolved CSS values that Chrome uses to render an element:

- CSS derived from [inheritance](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/inheritance)
- [Cascade](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Cascade) winners
- Longhand properties (precise), not shorthand (concise)
- Computed values, for example, `font-size: 14px` instead of `font-size: 70%`

## Search for duplicates {: #filter }

To investigate a specific property and its potential duplicates, type that property name in the **Filter** textbox. You can do this both in the **Styles** and **Computed** panes.

{% Img src="image/NJdAV9UgKuN8AhoaPBquL7giZQo1/YF2aohEStRzAOvSQfWVj.png", alt="The Filter textboxes on Styles and Computed panes.", width="800", height="339" %}

See [Search and filter an element's CSS](/docs/devtools/css/reference/#filter).

## Find unused CSS {: #coverage }

See [Coverage: Find unused JavaScript and CSS](/docs/devtools/coverage/).
