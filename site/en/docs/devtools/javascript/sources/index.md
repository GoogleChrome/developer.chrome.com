Use the Chrome DevTools **Sources** panel to:

- [View files][1].
- [Edit CSS and JavaScript][2].
- [Create and save **Snippets** of JavaScript][3], which you can run on any page. **Snippets** are
  similar to bookmarklets.
- [Debug JavaScript][4].
- [Set up a Workspace][5], so that changes you make in DevTools get saved to the code on your file
  system.

## View files {: #files }

Use the **Page** pane to view all of the resources that the page has loaded.

{% Img src="image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/smmuE51BssHZBgSb2Ytb.png", alt="The Page pane.", width="800", height="536" %}

How the **Page** pane is organized:

- The top-level, such as `top` on the screenshot above, represents an [HTML frame][6]. You'll find `top` on
  every page that you visit. `top` represents the main document frame.
- The second-level, such as `developers.google.com` on the screenshot above, represents an [origin][7].
- The third-level, fourth-level, and so on, represent directories and resources that were loaded
  from that origin. For example, on the screenshot above, the full path to the resource 
  `devsite-googler-button` is `developers.google.com/_static/19aa27122b/css/devsite-googler-button`.

Click a file in the **Page** pane to view its contents in the **Editor** pane. You can view any type
of file. For images, you see a preview of the image.

### Group authored and deployed files on the Page pane {: #group-authored-and-deployed }

{% Aside %}
**Note**: This is an {% Img src="image/NJdAV9UgKuN8AhoaPBquL7giZQo1/XfSWf04g2cwpnFcmp40m.svg", alt="Experimental.", width="20", height="20" %} experimental feature available in Chrome from version 104.
{% endAside %}

When developing web applications using frameworks (for example, [React](https://reactjs.org/) or [Angular](https://angular.io/)), it can be difficult to navigate sources due to the minified files generated by the build tools (for example, [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) or [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)).

To help you navigate sources, the **Sources** > **Page** pane can group the files into two categories:

- {% Img src="image/NJdAV9UgKuN8AhoaPBquL7giZQo1/KIgoYfQUdaCtgDLdYKSE.svg", alt="Code icon.", width="24", height="24" %} **Authored**. Similar to the source files you view in your IDE. DevTools generates these files based on sourcemaps provided by your build tools.
- {% Img src="image/NJdAV9UgKuN8AhoaPBquL7giZQo1/KDnkz7biIKbfQktK3HXX.svg", alt="Deployed icon.", width="22", height="22" %} **Deployed**. The actual files that the browser reads. Usually these files are minified.

To enable grouping, check **Group files by Authored/Deployed** at the top of the **Page** pane.

{% Img src="image/NJdAV9UgKuN8AhoaPBquL7giZQo1/SWqVMO6BUHncb2GjlvLq.png", alt="Grouping files by Authored / Deployed.", width="800", height="433" %}

## Edit CSS and JavaScript {: #edit }

Use the **Editor** pane to edit CSS and JavaScript. DevTools updates the page to run your new code.
For example, if you edit the `background-color` of an element, you'll see that change take effect
immediately.

{% Img src="image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/p0sdJ5tx5yQx1cuOLimO.gif", alt="Editing CSS in the Editor pane", width="800", height="461" %}

CSS changes take effect immediately, no save needed. For JavaScript changes to take effect, press
Command+S (Mac) or Control+S (Windows, Linux). DevTools doesn't re-run a script, so the only
JavaScript changes that take effect are those that you make inside of functions. For example, note
 how `console.log('A')` doesn't run, whereas `console.log('B')` does.

{% Img src="image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/vtNDAWnzXAV5H0cjkZdT.gif", alt="Editing JavaScript in the Editor pane.", width="800", height="461" %}

If DevTools re-ran the entire script after making the change, then the text `A` would have been logged to the
**Console**.

DevTools erases your CSS and JavaScript changes when you reload the page. See [Set up a
Workspace][8] to learn how to save the changes to your file system.

## Create, save, and run Snippets {: #snippets }

Snippets are scripts which you can run on any page. Imagine that you repeatedly type out the
following code in the **Console**, in order to insert the jQuery library into a page, so that you
can run jQuery commands from the **Console**:

```js
let script = document.createElement('script');
script.src = 'https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js';
script.crossOrigin = 'anonymous';
script.integrity = 'sha256-hwg4gsxgFZhOsEEamdOYGBf13FyQuiTwlAQgxVSNgt4=';
document.head.appendChild(script);
```

Instead, you can save this code in a **Snippet** and run it with a couple of button clicks, any time
you need it. DevTools saves the **Snippet** to your file system. For example, examine a **Snippet**
that inserts the jQuery library into a page.

{% Img src="image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/nl6ALIOWRQZdn35Y86ip.png", alt="A Snippet that inserts the jQuery library into a page.", width="800", height="430" %}

To run a **Snippet**:

- Open the file in the **Snippets** pane, and click **Run** {% Img src="image/NJdAV9UgKuN8AhoaPBquL7giZQo1/bJ1ZWs8NN8S0NaZnCHyQ.svg", alt="The Run button.", width="24", height="24" %} on the action bar at the bottom.
- Open the [**Command Menu**][9], delete the `>` character, type `!`, type the name of your
  **Snippet**, then press Enter.

See [Run Snippets Of Code From Any Page][10] to learn more.

## Debug JavaScript {: #debug }

Rather than using `console.log()` to infer where your JavaScript is going wrong, consider using the
Chrome DevTools debugging tools, instead. The general idea is to set a breakpoint, which is an
intentional stopping place in your code, and then step through your code's execution, one line at a
time.

{% Img src="image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/FKKzVSy54zN5nRV0DkVk.png", alt="Pausing at a breakpoint.", width="800", height="526" %}

As you step through the code, you can view and change the values of all currently-defined
properties and variables, run JavaScript in the **Console**, and more.

See [Get Started With Debugging JavaScript][11] to learn the basics of debugging in DevTools.

## Set up a Workspace {: #workspace }

By default, when you edit a file in the **Sources** panel, those changes are lost when you reload
the page. **Workspaces** enable you to save the changes that you make in DevTools to your file
system. Essentially, this lets you use DevTools as your code editor.

See [Edit Files With Workspaces][12] to get started.
