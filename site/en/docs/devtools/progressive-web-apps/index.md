Use the **Application** panel to inspect, modify, and debug web app manifests, service workers, and
service worker caches.

[Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)][1] are modern, high quality applications built using web technology.
PWAs offer similar capabilities to iOS, Android, and desktop apps. They are:

- Reliable even in unstable network conditions.
- Installable to launch surfaces of operating systems, such as the **Applications** folder on Mac OS X,
  the **Start** menu on Windows, and the home screen on Android and iOS.
- Show up in activity switchers, device search engines such as Spotlight, and in content sharing sheets.

This guide only discusses the Progressive Web App features of the **Application** panel. If you're
looking for help on the other panes, check out the last section of this guide, [Other Application
panel guides][2].

## Summary {: #summary }

- Use the **Manifest** pane to inspect your web app manifest.
- Use the **Service Workers** pane for a whole range of service-worker-related tasks, like
  unregistering or updating a service, emulating push events, going offline, or stopping a service
  worker.
- View your service worker cache from the **Cache Storage** pane.
- Unregister a service worker and clear all storage and caches with a single button click from the
  **Clear storage** pane.

## Web app manifest {: #manifest }

If you want your users to be able to add your app to their the **Applications** folder on Mac OS X,
the **Start** menu on Windows, and the home screen on Android and iOS, you need a [web app
manifest][3]. The manifest defines how the app appears on the home screen, where to direct the user when
launching from home screen, and what the app looks like on launch.

Once you've got your manifest set up, you can use the **Manifest** pane of the **Application** panel
to inspect it.

- To look at the manifest source, click the link below **App Manifest** label
  (`https://airhorner.com/manifest.json` in the screenshot above).
- The **Identity** and **Presentation** sections just display fields from the manifest source in a
  more user-friendly way.
- The **Protocol Handlers** section lets you to test the URL protocol handler registration of your PWA with a click of a button.
  To learn more, see [Test URL protocol handler registration](#test-protocol-handler).
- The **Icons** section displays every icon that you've specified.

### Trigger installation {: #trigger-installation }

Chrome makes it possible for you to enable and promote the installation of your PWA directly within its user interface.
Learn [How to provide your own in-app installation experience][4].

To trigger the installation flow of your PWA:

1. Open the PWA's landing page in Chrome.
1. On the right side of the address bar at the top, click {% Img src="image/NJdAV9UgKuN8AhoaPBquL7giZQo1/ewOETYv1jmGaqDKl0363.svg", alt="Install.", width="24", height="24" %} **Install**.

   {% Img src="image/NJdAV9UgKuN8AhoaPBquL7giZQo1/jiBO2oDEU5TYKKBNfuMc.png", alt="The Install button.", width="800", height="577" %}

1. Follow the on-screen instructions.

{% Aside 'gotchas' %}
Keep the **Console** drawer open when you trigger installation. The **Console**
tells you if your manifest has any issues and logs other information about the installation
lifecycle.
{% endAside %}

The **Install app** feature cannot simulate the workflow for mobile devices. Notice how
the desktop Chrome browser displays the installation button in the address bar, even though DevTools is in [Device Mode](/docs/devtools/device-mode/).
However, if you can successfully add your app to your desktop, then it'll work for
mobile, too.

If you want to test out the genuine mobile experience, you can connect a real mobile device to
DevTools via [remote debugging][6]. To trigger the installation on the connected mobile device, open the {% Img src="image/NJdAV9UgKuN8AhoaPBquL7giZQo1/N5Lkpdwpaz4YqRGFr2Ks.svg", alt="Three-dot menu.", width="22", height="22" %} three-dot menu and click {% Img src="image/NJdAV9UgKuN8AhoaPBquL7giZQo1/YwNSnnzuZ3dJwtVhcC4I.svg", alt="Install app.", width="24", height="24" %} **Install app**.

### Test URL protocol handler registration {: #test-protocol-handler }

PWAs can handle links that use a specific protocol for a more integrated experience.
To learn how to create a handler, see [URL protocol handler registration for PWAs](https://web.dev/url-protocol-handler/).

To test your handler:

1. [Open DevTools](/docs/devtools/open/) on the landing page of your PWA. For example, check out this [demo PWA](https://protocol-handler.glitch.me/).
1. From the demo page, install the PWA and reload the app after the installation. The browser has now registered the PWA as a handler for the `web+coffee` protocol.
1. In the **Application** > **Manifest** > **Protocol Handler** section, enter the URL you want the handler to test and click **Test protocol**.
   {% Img src="image/NJdAV9UgKuN8AhoaPBquL7giZQo1/eV8j54Q0sK8Rf8FbVx2Y.png", alt="Testing the handler.", width="800", height="415" %}
   In this example, the handler can process `americano`, `chai`, and `latte-macchiato`.
1. When Chrome asks you if it can open the app, confirm by clicking **Open Protocol Handler**.
   {% Img src="image/NJdAV9UgKuN8AhoaPBquL7giZQo1/5erFmV4W0QaZl9ey1d8A.png", alt="Open the app.", width="800", height="524" %}
1. In the next dialog, allow the app to handle `web+coffee` links.
   {% Img src="image/NJdAV9UgKuN8AhoaPBquL7giZQo1/wJbd9nGPkLCap9423xwk.png", alt="Allow to handle links.", width="500", height="300" %}

If the handler successfully processes the link, you'll see an image of a coffee cup opened in the app.

## Service workers {: #service-workers }

Service workers are a fundamental technology in the future web platform. They are scripts that the
browser runs in the background, separate from a web page. These scripts enable you to access
features that don't need a web page or user interaction, like push notifications, background sync,
and offline experiences.

Related Guides:

- [Intro to Service Workers][7]
- [Push Notifications: Timely, Relevant, and Precise][8]

The **Service Workers** pane in the **Application** panel is the main place in DevTools to inspect
and debug service workers.

{% Img src="image/admin/6DPB4hljonLW1hVhaka5.png", alt="service worker pane", width="718", height="415" %}

- If a service worker is installed to the currently open page, then you'll see it listed on this
  pane. For example, in the screenshot above there's a service worker installed for the scope of
  `https://events.google.com/io2016/`.
- The **Offline** checkbox puts DevTools into offline mode. This is equivalent to the offline mode
  available from the **Network** panel, or the `Go offline` option in the [Command Menu][9].
- The **Update on reload** checkbox forces the service worker to update on every page load.
- The **Bypass for network** checkbox bypasses the service worker and forces the browser to go to
  the network for requested resources.
- The **Update** button performs a one-time update of the specified service worker.
- The **Push** button emulates a push notification without a payload (also known as a [tickle][10]).
- The **Sync** button emulates a background sync event.
- The **Unregister** button unregisters the specified service worker. Check out [Clear storage][11]
  for a way to unregister a service worker and wipe storage and caches with a single button click.
- The **Source** line tells you when the currently running service worker was installed. The link is
  the name of the service worker's source file. Clicking on the link sends you to the service
  worker's source.
- The **Status** line tells you the status of the service worker. The number on this line (`#1` in
  the screenshot above) indicates how many times the service worker has been updated. If you enable
  the **update on reload** checkbox you'll notice that the number increments on every page load.
  Next to the status you'll see a **start** button (if the service worker is stopped) or a **stop**
  button (if the service worker is running). Service workers are designed to be stopped and started
  by the browser at any time. Explicitly stopping your service worker using the **stop** button can
  simulate that. Stopping your service worker is a great way to test how your code behaves when the
  service worker starts back up again. It frequently reveals bugs due to faulty assumptions about
  persistent global state.
- The **Clients** line tells you the origin that the service worker is scoped to. The **focus**
  button is mostly useful when you've enabled the **show all** checkbox. When that checkbox is
  enabled, all registered service workers are listed. If you click on the **focus** button next to a
  service worker that is running in a different tab, Chrome focuses on that tab.

If the service worker causes any errors, a new label called **Errors** shows up.

{% Img src="image/admin/EhulxkNH9EIAwVbQX6Xd.png", alt="service worker with errors", width="508", height="296" %}

## Service worker caches {: #caches }

The **Cache Storage** pane provides a read-only list of resources that have been cached using the
(service worker) [Cache API][12].

{% Img src="image/admin/KLqhHBwpNPFGTiv1kUTR.png", alt="service worker cache pane", width="800", height="421" %}

Note that the first time you open a cache and add a resource to it, DevTools might not detect the
change. Reload the page and you should see the cache.

If you've got two or more caches open, you'll see them listed below the **Cache Storage** dropdown.

{% Img src="image/admin/mK84c0i8pMq3hPTXCNpv.png", alt="multiple service worker caches", width="800", height="206" %}

## Quota usage {: #opaque-responses }

Some responses within the Cache Storage pane may be flagged as being "[opaque][13]". This refers to
a response retrieved from a different origin, like from a [CDN][14] or remote API, when [CORS][15]
is not enabled.

In order to avoid leakage of cross-domain information, there's significant padding added to the size
of an opaque response used for calculating storage quota limits (i.e. whether a `QuotaExceeded`
exception is thrown) and reported by the [`navigator.storage` API][16].

The details of this padding vary from browser to browser, but for Google Chrome, this means that the
_minimum_ size that any single cached opaque response contributes to the overall storage usage is
[approximately 7 megabytes][17]. You should keep this in mind when determining how many opaque
responses you want to cache, since you could easily exceeded storage quota limitations much sooner
than you'd otherwise expect based on the actual size of the opaque resources.

## Clear storage {: #clear-storage }

The **Clear Storage** pane is a very useful feature when developing progressive web apps. This pane
lets you unregister service workers and clear all caches and storage with a single button click.
