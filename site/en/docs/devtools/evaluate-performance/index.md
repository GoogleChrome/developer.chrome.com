**Note:** See [Optimize Website Speed][1] to learn how make your pages load faster.

{% endAside %}

Runtime performance is how your page performs when it is running, as opposed to loading. This
tutorial teaches you how to use the Chrome DevTools Performance panel to analyze runtime
performance. In terms of the [RAIL][2] model, the skills you learn in this tutorial are useful for
analyzing the Response, Animation, and Idle phases of your page.

{% Aside "caution" %}

**Caution:** This tutorial is based on Chrome 59. If you use another version of Chrome, the UI and
features of DevTools may be different. Check `chrome://help` to see what version of Chrome you're
running.

{% endAside %}

## Get started {: #get-started }

In this tutorial, you open DevTools on a live page and use the Performance panel to find a
performance bottleneck on the page.

1.  Open Google Chrome in [Incognito Mode][3]. Incognito Mode ensures that Chrome runs in a clean
    state. For example, if you have a lot of extensions installed, those extensions might create
    noise in your performance measurements.
2.  Load the following page in your Incognito window. This is the demo that you're going to profile.
    The page shows a bunch of little blue squares moving up and down.

    `https://googlechrome.github.io/devtools-samples/jank/`

3.  Press Command+Option+I (Mac) or Control+Shift+I (Windows, Linux) to open DevTools.

    **Figure 1**. The demo on the left, and DevTools on the right

    {% Aside %}

    **Note**: For the rest of the screenshots, DevTools is [undocked to a separate window][4] so
    that you can see its contents better.

    {% endAside %}

### Simulate a mobile CPU {: #simulate_a_mobile_cpu }

Mobile devices have much less CPU power than desktops and laptops. Whenever you profile a page, use
CPU Throttling to simulate how your page performs on mobile devices.

1.  In DevTools, click the **Performance** tab.
2.  Make sure that the **Screenshots** checkbox is enabled.
3.  Click **Capture Settings**
    {% Img src="image/admin/4LzQVJAubPkguM9kg402.png", alt="Capture Settings", width="28", height="28" %}.
    DevTools reveals settings related to how it captures performance metrics.
4.  For **CPU**, select **2x slowdown**. DevTools throttles your CPU so that it's 2 times slower
    than usual.

    {% Img src="image/admin/ah6pOJ4pk0HgCcohE5ak.svg", alt="CPU throttling", width="800", height="527" %}

    **Figure 2**. CPU throttling, outlined in blue

    {% Aside %}

    **Note**: When testing other pages, if you want to ensure that they work well on low-end mobile
    devices, set CPU Throttling to **20x slowdown**. This demo doesn't work well with 20x slowdown,
    so it just uses 2x slowdown for instructional purposes.

    {% endAside %}

### Set up the demo {: #set_up_the_demo }

It's hard to create a runtime performance demo that works consistently for all readers of this
website. This section lets you customize the demo to ensure that your experience is relatively
consistent with the screenshots and descriptions you see in this tutorial, regardless of your
particular setup.

1.  Keep clicking **Add 10** until the blue squares move noticeably slower than before. On a
    high-end machine, it may take about 20 clicks.
2.  Click **Optimize**. The blue squares should move faster and more smoothly.

    {% Aside %}

    **Note**: If you don't see a noticeable difference between the optimized and un-optimized
    versions, try clicking **Subtract 10** a few times and trying again. If you add too many blue
    squares, you're just going to max out the CPU and you're not going to see a major difference in
    the results for the two versions.

    {% endAside %}

3.  Click **Un-Optimize**. The blue squares move slower and with more jank again.

### Record runtime performance {: #record }

When you ran the optimized version of the page, the blue squares move faster. Why is that? Both
versions are supposed to move each square the same amount of space in the same amount of time. Take
a recording in the Performance panel to learn how to detect the performance bottleneck in the
un-optimized version.

1.  In DevTools, click **Record**
    {% Img src="image/admin/gEStzrqw8NDLLcN1siJB.png", alt="Record", width="24", height="24" %}. DevTools captures
    performance metrics as the page runs.

    {% Img src="image/admin/eZtzzkEKshRv8KFYbajF.png", alt="Profiling the page", width="800", height="527" %}

    **Figure 3**: Profiling the page

2.  Wait a few seconds.
3.  Click **Stop**. DevTools stops recording, processes the data, then displays the results on the
    Performance panel.

    {% Img src="image/admin/lj5ApwyK5o0YmdcYeHjh.png", alt="The results of the profile", width="800", height="889" %}

    **Figure 4**: The results of the profile

Wow, that's an overwhelming amount of data. Don't worry, it'll all make more sense shortly.

## Analyze the results {: #analyze }

Once you've got a recording of the page's performance, you can measure how poor the page's
performance is, and find the cause(s).

### Analyze frames per second {: #analyze_frames_per_second }

The main metric for measuring the performance of any animation is frames per second (FPS). Users are
happy when animations run at 60 FPS.

1.  Look at the **FPS** chart. Whenever you see a red bar above **FPS**, it means that the framerate
    dropped so low that it's probably harming the user experience. In general, the higher the green
    bar, the higher the FPS.

    {% Img src="image/admin/rLbUyQ0Y0p6xIiwy85SK.svg", alt="The FPS chart", width="800", height="530" %}

    **Figure 5**: The FPS chart, outlined in blue

2.  Below the **FPS** chart you see the **CPU** chart. The colors in the **CPU** chart correspond to
    the colors in the **Summary** tab, at the bottom of the Performance panel. The fact that the
    **CPU** chart is full of color means that the CPU was maxed out during the recording. Whenever
    you see the CPU maxed out for long periods, it's a cue to find ways to do less work.

    {% Img src="image/admin/XFtPfdKzTPBXeQC9g9OC.svg", alt="The CPU chart and Summary tab", width="800", height="889" %}

    **Figure 6**: The CPU chart and Summary tab, outlined in blue

3.  Hover your mouse over the **FPS**, **CPU**, or **NET** charts. DevTools shows a screenshot of
    the page at that point in time. Move your mouse left and right to replay the recording. This is
    called scrubbing, and it's useful for manually analyzing the progression of animations.

    {% Img src="image/admin/HwxH2YN7r7EbH6X7O9nD.png", alt="Viewing a screenshot", width="800", height="528" %}

    **Figure 7**: Viewing a screenshot of the page around the 2000ms mark of the recording

4.  In the **Frames** section, hover your mouse over one of the green squares. DevTools shows you
    the FPS for that particular frame. Each frame is probably well below the target of 60 FPS.

    {% Img src="image/admin/8CgXsm3N7ZoqexM4papz.png", alt="Hovering over a frame", width="800", height="542" %}

    **Figure 8**: Hovering over a frame

Of course, with this demo, it's pretty obvious that the page is not performing well. But in real
scenarios, it may not be so clear, so having all of these tools to make measurements comes in handy.

#### Bonus: Open the FPS meter {: #bonus_open_the_fps_meter }

Another handy tool is the FPS meter, which provides real-time estimates for FPS as the page runs.

1.  Press Command+Shift+P (Mac) or Control+Shift+P (Windows, Linux) to open the Command Menu.
2.  Start typing `Rendering` in the Command Menu and select **Show Rendering**.
3.  In the **Rendering** tab, enable **FPS Meter**. A new overlay appears in the top-right of your
    viewport.

    {% Img src="image/admin/CnzqipAr4ZLTZMhzj9tQ.png", alt="The FPS meter", width="800", height="593" %}

    **Figure 9**: The FPS meter

4.  Disable the **FPS Meter** and press Escape to close the **Rendering** tab. You won't be using it
    in this tutorial.

### Find the bottleneck {: #find_the_bottleneck }

Now that you've measured and verified that the animation is not performing well, the next question
to answer is: why?

1.  Note the summary tab. When no events are selected, this tab shows you a breakdown of activity.
    The page spent most of its time rendering. Since performance is the art of doing less work, your
    goal is to reduce the amount of time spent doing rendering work.

    {% Img src="image/admin/icVAEBrsTnHXfg68xO0W.svg", alt="The Summary tab", width="800", height="716" %}

    **Figure 10**: The Summary tab, outlined in blue

2.  Expand the **Main** section. DevTools shows you a flame chart of activity on the main thread,
    over time. The x-axis represents the recording, over time. Each bar represents an event. A wider
    bar means that event took longer. The y-axis represents the call stack. When you see events
    stacked on top of each other, it means the upper events caused the lower events.

    {% Img src="image/admin/SqkREdHdAzgeXavWwMtC.svg", alt="The Main section", width="800", height="662" %}

    **Figure 11**: The Main section, outlined in blue

3.  There's a lot of data in the recording. Zoom in on a single **Animation Frame Fired** event by
    clicking, holding, and dragging your mouse over the **Overview**, which is the section that
    includes the **FPS**, **CPU**, and **NET** charts. The **Main** section and **Summary** tab only
    display information for the selected portion of the recording.

    {% Img src="image/admin/ZKsCP4UtDA1wxaqGHqi7.png", alt="Zoomed in on a single Animation Frame Fired event", width="800", height="622" %}

    **Figure 12**: Zoomed in on a single Animation Frame Fired event

    {% Aside %}

    **Note**: Another way to zoom is to focus the **Main** section by clicking its background or
    selecting an event, and then press the W, A, S, and D keys.

    {% endAside %}

4.  Note the red triangle in the top-right of the **Animation Frame Fired** event. Whenever you see
    a red triangle, it's a warning that there may be an issue related to this event.

    {% Aside %}

    **Note**: The **Animation Frame Fired** event occurs whenever a [`requestAnimationFrame()`][5]
    callback is executed.

    {% endAside %}

5.  Click the **Animation Frame Fired** event. The **Summary** tab now shows you information about
    that event. Note the **reveal** link. Clicking that causes DevTools to highlight the event that
    initiated the **Animation Frame Fired** event. Also note the **app.js:94** link. Clicking that
    jumps you to the relevant line in the source code.

    {% Img src="image/admin/IeZiW7iMHzE1MwxqFPAg.png", alt="More information about the Animation Frame Fired event", width="800", height="821" %}

    **Figure 13**: More information about the Animation Frame Fired event

    {% Aside %}

    **Note**: After selecting an event, use the arrow keys to select the events next to it.

    {% endAside %}

6.  Under the **app.update** event, there's a bunch of purple events. If they were wider, it looks
    as though each one might have a red triangle on it. Click one of the purple **Layout** events
    now. DevTools provides more information about the event in the **Summary** tab. Indeed, there's
    a warning about forced reflows (another word for layout).
7.  In the **Summary** tab, click the **app.js:70** link under **Layout Forced**. DevTools takes you
    to the line of code that forced the layout.

    {% Img src="image/admin/q9y3chHXU2LoRUvc62JS.png", alt="The line of code that caused the forced layout", width="800", height="513" %}

    **Figure 13**: The line of code that caused the forced layout

    {% Aside %}

    **Note**: The problem with this code is that, in each animation frame, it changes the style for
    each square, and then queries the position of each square on the page. Because the styles
    changed, the browser doesn't know if each square's position changed, so it has to re-layout the
    square in order to compute its position. See [Avoid forced synchronous layouts][6] to learn
    more.

    {% endAside %}

Phew! That was a lot to take in, but you now have a solid foundation in the basic workflow for
analyzing runtime performance. Good job.

### Bonus: Analyze the optimized version {: #bonus_analyze_the_optimized_version }

Using the workflows and tools that you just learned, click **Optimize** on the demo to enable the
optimized code, take another performance recording, and then analyze the results. From the improved
framerate to the reduction in events in the **Main** section's flame chart, you can see that the
optimized version of the app does much less work, resulting in better performance.

{% Aside %}

**Note:** Even this "optimized" version isn't that great, because it still manipulates the `top`
property of each square. A better approach is to stick to properties that only affect compositing.
See [Use transform and opacity changes for animations][7] for more information.

{% endAside %}

## Next steps {: #next_steps }

The foundation for understanding performance is the RAIL model. This model teaches you the
performance metrics that are most important to your users. See [Measure Performance With The RAIL
Model][8] to learn more.

To get more comfortable with the Performance panel, practice makes perfect. Try profiling your own
pages and analyzing the results. If you have any questions about your results, [open a Stack
Overflow question tagged with `google-chrome-devtools`][9]. Include screenshots or links to
reproducible pages, if possible.

To become an expert in runtime performance, you've got to learn how the browser translates HTML,
CSS, and JS into pixels on a screen. The best place to start is the [Rendering Performance
Overview][10]. [The Anatomy Of A Frame][11] dives into even more detail.

Last, there are many ways to improve runtime performance. This tutorial focused on one particular
animation bottleneck to give you a focused tour through the Performance panel, but it's only one of
many bottlenecks you may encounter. The rest of the Rendering Performance series has a lot of good
tips for improving various aspects of runtime performance, such as:
