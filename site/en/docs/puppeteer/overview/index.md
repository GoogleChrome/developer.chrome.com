Puppeteer is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control
[headless](/blog/headless-chrome/) Chrome or Chromium over the
[DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/). It
can also be configured to use full (non-headless) Chrome or Chromium.

## What can I do?

Most things that you can do manually in the browser can be done using Puppeteer! Here are a few examples to get you started:

- Generate screenshots and PDFs of pages.
- Crawl a SPA (Single-Page Application) and generate pre-rendered content ("SSR" (Server-Side Rendering)).
- Automate actions such as form submission, UI testing, keyboard input.
- Create an up-to-date, automated testing environment. Run your tests directly in the latest version of Chrome using the latest JavaScript and browser features.
- Capture a timeline trace of your site to help diagnose performance issues.
- Test Chrome Extensions.

## Next steps
