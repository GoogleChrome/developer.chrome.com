<p>The Native Client Developer&#x2019;s Guide includes practical information you need to
get your development cycle up and running (e.g., how to compile and test-run
your application), as well as important concepts you need to understand in order
to code your application (e.g., how an application is structured, and how to use
the Pepper APIs).</p>
<p>The Developer&#x2019;s Guide is a work-in-progress.
