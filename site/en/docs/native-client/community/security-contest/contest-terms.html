<p>ENTRY IN THIS CONTEST CONSTITUTES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS AND
CONDITIONS.</p>
<ol>
<li><p class="first">Binding Agreement</p>
<p>In order to enter the Native Client Security Contest (&#x201C;Contest&#x201D;),
you must agree to these Terms and Conditions (&#x201C;Terms&#x201D;). Therefore,
please read these Terms prior to entry to ensure you understand and
agree. You agree that submission of an entry in the Contest
constitutes your agreement to these Terms. After reading the Terms
and in order to participate, each Participant (as defined below)
must complete the registration form, clicking the &#x201C;I understand and
agree&#x201D; box (or the equivalent), on the Contest entry webpage. Once
the Participant clicks the &#x201C;I understand and agree&#x201D; box (or the
equivalent), the Terms form a binding legal agreement between each
Participant and Google with respect to the Contest.</p>
<p>Participants may not submit an Exploit, Issue or Summary to the
Contest and are not eligible to receive the prizes described in
these Terms unless they agree to these Terms. If a Participant is
part of a team, each member of the team must read and agree to
these Terms and click on the &#x201C;I understand and agree&#x201D; box (or the
equivalent) described herein. Failure of any member of a team to
agree to these Terms and click on the &#x201C;I understand and agree&#x201D; box
(or the equivalent) described herein will disqualify the entire
team.</p>
<p>By entering, Participant warrants that Participant has not violated
any employment agreement or other restriction imposed by their
employer by participating in this Contest.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Description</p>
<p>The Contest is organized by Google and is designed to motivate the
developer community to identify and report security Exploits (as
defined below) on Google&#x2019;s Native Client software and reward those
developers who identify one or more security Exploits that are
evaluated as a winning exploit by the Judges.</p>
<p>Once a Participant has registered for the Contest, the Participant
will be asked to identify security Exploits in Google&#x2019;s Native
Client Software and enter those Exploits on Google&#x2019;s <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/list">Native Client
Issue Tracker</a>
website using the &#x201C;Security Contest Template.&#x201D; At this point, the
Exploit will become an Issue and will no longer be able to be
identified by another Participant. Google will then verify that the
Issue is reproducible. If so, that Issue will become a Verified
Issue. Finally, the Participant will submit a Summary of up to their
top ten best Issues that were submitted on the <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/list">Native
Client Issue Tracker</a>. Since it is
possible that an Issue may not be verified until after the Contest
End Date, if a Participant includes such an Issue in their Summary
and such Issue is not ultimately verified, then that Issue will not
be considered to be part of the Summary.</p>
<p>Prizes will be awarded to those Participants who submit the best
Summaries as determined in the sole discretion of the Judges when
considering the Judging Criteria described herein.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Sponsor</p>
<p>The Contest is sponsored by Google Inc. (&#x201C;Google&#x201D; or &#x201C;Sponsor&#x201D;), a
Delaware corporation with its principal place of business at 1600
Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA, 94043, USA.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Term</p>
<p>The Contest begins at 9:00:00 A.M. Pacific Time (PT) Zone in the
United States on Februrary 25th, 2009 (&#x201C;Contest Start Date&#x201D;) and
ends at 11:59:59 P.M. PT on May 5th, 2009 (&#x201C;Contest End
Date&#x201D;). Participants must register by May 5th, 2009 at 11:59:59
Pacific Time to be eligible to participate. ENTRANTS ARE
RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING THE CORRESPONDING TIME ZONE IN THEIR
RESPECTIVE JURISDICTIONS.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Definitions</p>
<p>Throughout these Terms, Google will use the following defined terms
and words. Please review them carefully to ensure you understand.</p>
<ol>
<li>Covert Channel Attack: A &#x201C;Covert Channel Attack&#x201D; means an
attempt to manipulate certain properties of a communications
medium in an unexpected, unconventional, or unforeseen way in
order to transmit information through the medium without
detection by anyone other than the entities operating the covert
channel. Exploits that are Covert Channel Attacks are excluded
from the Contest.</li>
<li>Exploit: An &#x201C;Exploit&#x201D; means a sequence of steps that require and
use Native Client to produce or have the potential to produce
behavior prohibited by Native Client&#x2019;s security policies and
design which can be found at
<a class="reference external" href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/native_client/trunk/src/native_client/README.html">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/native_client/trunk/src/native_client/README.html</a>.
Google reserves the right to modify the security policies and
design at any time. An example of an Exploit would be producing
file system or network access outside of the scope of
permissible use via JavaScript in a browser. An Exploit that
defeats one but not all Native Client security measures is still
considered to produce behavior prohibited by Native Client&#x2019;s
security policies for the purposes of this Contest and would be
entitled to be identified as an Exploit in the Contest.</li>
<li>Inner Sandbox: The &#x201C;Inner Sandbox&#x201D; means the Native Client
security system that a) inspects executables before running them
to try to detect the potential for an executable to produce
prohibited behavior, and b) prevents from running any
executables that are detected to have the potential to produce
prohibited behavior.</li>
<li>Issue: An &#x201C;Issue&#x201D; means an entry of a single Exploit by a
Participant into the <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/list">Native Client Issue Tracker</a> using a
properly filled out Security Contest Template. Once the Exploit
has been properly entered it becomes an Issue.</li>
<li>Native Client Issue Tracker: The &#x201C;Native Client Issue Tracker&#x201D;
is located at
<a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/list">http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/list</a>. It is a web
application that manages and maintains a list of Issues,
including Issues that are not eligible for contest entry.</li>
<li>Native Client Version Number: The &#x201C;Native Client Version Number&#x201D;
is defined as the number between the platform name (separated by
an &#x2018;_&#x2019;) and the file extension (separated by a &#x2018;.&#x2019;) in the
Native Client download. For example, if the the filename of the
download on the Native Client download page is
&#x201C;nacl_linux_0.1_32_2009_01_16.tgz&#x201D; or
&#x201C;nacl_windows_0.1_32_2009_01_16.zip&#x201D;, the Version Number is
&#x201C;0.1_32_2009_01_16&#x201D;.</li>
<li>Outer Sandbox: The &#x201C;Outer Sandbox&#x201D; means the Native Client
security system that 1) observes executables while they are
running to detect the attempts at prohibited behavior and 2)
terminates misbehaving executables if it observes any attempts
to produce prohibited behavior.</li>
<li>Participant: A &#x201C;Participant&#x201D; means any individual or team of
individuals that has agreed to these Terms, meets the
eligibility criteria described below, and is participating in
the Contest.</li>
<li>Side Channel Attack: A &#x201C;Side Channel Attack&#x201D; means any attack
based on information gained as a side-effect of the
implementation of a cryptosystem, rather than brute force or
theoretical weaknesses in the algorithms. For example, attacks
that use timing information, power consumption variation,
electromagnetic leaks or sound to obtain information illicitly
are side channel attacks. Exploits that are Side Channel Attacks
are excluded from the Contest.</li>
<li>Summary: A &#x201C;Summary&#x201D; means the final electronic document
complying with the requirements of Section X that each
Participant must submit in order to participate in the
Contest. A Summary may contain up to 10 Issues. If Issues do not
ultimately become Verified Issues, they will not be considered
as part of the Summary and Participant understands and accepts
the risk that if the Participant identified an Issue on a
Summary that had not yet been verified, that Issue will not be
considered as part of the Summary if not subsequently verified.</li>
<li>Verified Issue: A &#x201C;Verified Issue&#x201D; means an Exploit that has
been a) submitted to the <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/list">Native Client Issue Tracker</a> in
accordance with these Terms, and b) confirmed by the Native
Client team at Google to exhibit the behavior described in the
Issue report.</li>

</li>
<li><p class="first">LIMIT ONE ENTRY PER PERSON. Individuals may only enter one time,
whether as an individual Participant or as a team
Participant. Google, in its sole discretion, may disqualify any
Participant (including team Participants) that it believes has
violated this provision.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Submission Process</p>
<ol>
<li>Each Participant must submit:<ol>
<li>At least one Issue in the <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/list">Native Client Issue Tracker</a> that
describes an Exploit and includes the information detailed
in the &#x201C;Issues&#x201D; section below. Any team member can submit an
Issue on behalf of the team. All entries will be deemed made
by the Authorized Account Holder of the email address
submitted at the time of entry.</li>
<li>One Summary per Participant that includes the information
detailed in the &#x201C;Summary&#x201D; section below. Participant will be
entitled to amend its Summary until the Contest End Date and
only the last version will be considered by the Judges.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Each Issue must be written in the English language. Google or
the Judges may refuse to review submissions that they deem
incomprehensible, include Issues that are not repeatable as
determined by Google, or that otherwise do not meet the
requirements of these Terms.</li>
<li>To enter an Issue in the <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/list">Native Client Issue Tracker</a>, each
Participant must use the &#x201C;Security Contest Template&#x201D; and provide
completely and accurately all information requested by the
template. Any Issues that are not entered with the &#x201C;Security
Contest Template&#x201D; may not be considered by the Judges. Each
Issue must contain the items described in the &#x201C;Issues&#x201D; section
of these Terms.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Issues</p>
<ol>
<li>Minimum requirements for Issues: Participant must identify an
Exploit and enter the Exploit into the <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/list">Native Client Issue
Tracker</a>. Once the
Exploit is submitted it becomes an Issue. Each submitted Issue
must include (i) the following information and (ii) all
additional information requested on the &#x201C;Security Contest
Template&#x201D;:<ol>
<li>The user name (in the case of Individual Participants) or
the team name (in the case of team Participants) of the
Participant submitting the Issue, which must be identical to
the user name or team name submitted during the registration
process.</li>
<li>A gzipped tar archive (with paths relative to
nacl/googleclient/native_client/tests/) that contains any
instructions and files necessary to reproduce the Exploit,
which must include:<ol>
<li>A README.txt file that describes:<ul>
<li>The version number of current version of Native Client
at the time of submission. Issues submitted with a
version number listed other than the current version
at the time of submission will be invalid;</li>
<li>The steps required to reproduce the Exploit;</li>
<li>The effect of the Exploit; and</li>
<li>Platform requirements for the Exploit, including but
not necessarily limited to:</li>
<li>browser version;</li>
<li>operating system name(s) and version(s); and/or</li>
<li>any other platform requirements relevant to the Exploit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the Exploit requires a binary executable, both the
source code and binary executable must be provided upon
creation of the Issue. Any subsequent updates to the
source code or binary executable after the creation of
the Issue will not be considered for the purposes of
this Contest. The binary executable must build cleanly
by executing the command &#x201C;make&#x201D; in the exploit directory
(e.g. nacl/googleclient/native_client/tests/exploit1).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Verified Issues: In order for an Issue to become a Verified
Issue, Google will first examine the submitted Issue to
determine whether it complies with the following:<ol>
<li>The Exploit must not contain or depend upon access or use of
any third party software or code that Google does not have
readily available to it or that would require complying with
third party license agreement that Google in its sole
discretion deems onerous or burdensome.</li>
<li>Google must be able to replicate the Exploit in its sole
discretion.</li>
<li>The Exploit must affect at least one &#x201C;opt-&#x201D; platform from a
standard build of the most recent released version of Native
Client as of the time of submission of the Issue for the
Exploit.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Timeliness<ol>
<li>If the vulnerability exposed by the submitted Exploit was
disclosed in a previously reported Issue (whether or not
submitted by a Participant) or in the previously published
Native Client release notes, the submission will be invalid
for the purposes of this Contest. Two Exploits are
considered to expose the same vulnerability if the
theoretical patch required to fix one vulnerability also
fixes the second vulnerability.</li>
<li>Google will update the Native Client source code base at
most twice per week. These updates, if they occur, will
appear Mondays and Thursdays between 3 p.m. and 8
p.m. Pacific Time.</li>
<li>Issues will not be valid if they have been entered before
the later of (i) the Contest Start Date or (ii) the time at
which all members of a team Participant or the individual
Participant, as the case may be, have accepted these Terms.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Excluded Exploits. The following types of Exploits are invalid
for the purposes of this Contest:<ul>
<li>Covert Channel Attacks;</li>
<li>Sidechannel Attacks;</li>
<li>Exploits requiring a virtualized CPU;</li>
<li>Exploits that rely on features, misfeatures or defects of
virtual machines (i.e. VMWare, Xen, Parallels etc.);</li>
<li>Exploits that require the machine to be previously compromised
by malicious software (including but not limited to viruses or
malware); and</li>
<li>Exploits that rely on hardware failures, other than Exploits
which, in Google&#x2019;s sole judgment, depend on CPU errata but
which can be reproduced reliably with a common system
configuration and under normal operating conditions, or
statistically improbable hardware behaviors. Examples include
but are not limited to Exploits that rely on memory errors
induced by cosmic radiation, and Exploits that require
abnormal heating, cooling or other abnormal physical
conditions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Completeness. Issues submitted that lack any of the above
materials or fail to meet any of the above criteria, may not be
considered in the judging process at Google&#x2019;s sole
discretion. Issues that are not included in a Participant
Summary (see section below) will not be considered.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Summary</p>
<ol>
<li>Every Participant must submit a Summary at the <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/list">Native Client
Issue Tracker</a> complying
with the requirements of this section. The Participant must
select no more than 10 of the Verified Issues submitted by the
Participant for inclusion on the Summary. Each Summary must be
in English and must contain the following information:<ul>
<li>The Issues must be listed in descending order of severity, as
determined by the Participant in accordance with the Judging
Criteria.</li>
<li>Each Issue listed in the Summary must be identified by ID
number of the Issue. The ID number is the identifying number
created for each Issue as listed on the <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/list">Native Client Issue
Tracker</a>.</li>
<li>A description of the effect of each Exploit.</li>
<li>The platform requirements of each Exploit.</li>
<li>The version number(s) of Native Client software affected by
each Exploit (which must be the version number of the Native
Client software current at the time the Issue was submitted to
the <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/list">Native Client Issue Tracker</a>).</li>
<li>Any other details about the Exploit and the submission that
are relevant to the judging criteria, such as, for example,
the approach used in finding the exploits, innovative or
scalable techniques used to discover exploits, or
architectural analysis.</li>
<li>The team name or user name of the Participant. Google may, in
its sole discretion, eliminate or disqualify any Summary that
lists user names or team names that are not identical to the
user name or team name of the Participant listed on the
Contest entry form.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Each Summary must be a maximum of 8 pages long, in PDF format
viewable with Adobe Reader version 9. The Summary must be
formatted for 8.5 inches x11 inches or A4 paper, with a minimum
font size of 10 pt. Any submission that does not meet these
formatting criteria may be disqualified at the sole discretion
of Google.</li>
<li>All Issues listed in the Summary will be verified by Google
before submission of the Summary to the Judges after the Contest
Closing Date. Participants may submit or resubmit their Summary
at any time during the duration of the Contest, however, the
Judges will consider only the last Summary from each Participant
prior to the Contest Closing Date and ignore all other Summaries
previously submitted by the Participant.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Judging</p>
<ol>
<li><p class="first">After the Contest End Date and on or about May 15th, 2009, all
submitted Summaries will be judged by one of at least three
panels with a minimum of three experts in the field of online
security (&#x201C;Judges&#x201D;) on each panel. Judges will evaluate each
Summary in accordance with the Judging Criteria described
below. Each panel will evaluate a number of the submitted
Summaries using the Judging Criteria described below and will
select the highest ranking Summaries to move to the next level
of judging. During the first round of judging, each panel will
select no more than ten Summaries to move forward to the second
round of judging unless there is a tie between or among any
Participants. During the second round of judging, those
Summaries selected during the first round of judging will then
be evaluated by all Judges using the below Judging Criteria and
the top five Summaries will be selected as potential
winners. All decisions of the Judges are final and binding.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Judging Criteria. The Judges will consider each Summary under
following judging criteria (&#x201C;Judging Criteria&#x201D;):</p>
<ol>
<li><p class="first">Quality of Exploit. Quality will be decided by the Judges in
their sole discretion and will be based on (in order of
importance to the Judges) Severity, Scope, Reliability and
Style.</p>
<ol>
<li><p class="first">Severity: the more disruptive the effects of the
Exploit, the higher its quality. Here is a
non-exhaustive ranking of the most common Exploits
starting from &#x2018;minor&#x2019; to &#x2018;severe&#x2019;:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Browser crash;</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Denial of service or machine crash;</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Compromise of the Outer Sandbox;</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Information leak (such as of a cookie or password);</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Compromise of both the Inner and Outer Sandbox; and/or</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Prohibited side effect (such as reading or writing
files to the client machine), escalation of privilege
(such as executing other programs outside of Native
Client).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Any Exploit that does not address the above elements
will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and the
severity of such Exploits will be determined solely at
the Judge&#x2019;s discretion.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Scope: the more computers that an Exploit would
potentially affect, the bigger its scope and therefore
higher the quality of the Exploit. Consider the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Exploits that affect all platforms supported by Native
Client (where platform is defined as a browser,
operating system and hardware combination) have higher
quality than an Exploit specific to a particular
platform.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Exploits that require non-current or beta versions
(historic or future) of hardware or software are lower
quality.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Exploits that rely on concurrent usage of other
installed software or web content must make a
compelling case about the likelihood of the
prerequisite software or content being present, or
they will be considered of lower quality.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Reliability: The more frequent or probable the
occurrence identified by the Exploit, the more
&#x201C;reliable&#x201D; it may be. Consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Exploits that require uncommon software to be
installed on the machine in order to function will be
deemed to have lower quality.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Entries that include Exploits that cannot be
reproduced 100% of the time, but which can be
reproduced a significant percentage of the time, will
be deemed to have a lower quality to account for a
lowered probability that the attack will succeed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Style: Submissions that demonstrate exceptional style
will receive a higher ranking. Factors that contribute
to style include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Ingenuity in mechanism used to bypass security;</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Uniqueness of the Exploit;</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Ingenuity in methods used to discover vulnerabilities;
and/or Minimal size of Exploit to achieve the effect.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p class="first">the Quantity of Exploits: Participants that submit more
Exploits in their Summary (but no more than 10) may receive
a higher ranking, weighted by quality. However, it is still
possible that a Participant who submits one Exploit could
still outweigh a Participant that submits several Exploits.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Considering each of the factors described above, the Judges will
give each Summary a &#x201C;Score&#x201D; from 1-10 that represents the Judges
evaluation of the Summary. This &#x201C;score&#x201D; will determine which
participants move from the first round of judging to the second
round of judging, and which participants will be selected as a
winner.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Winner Selection</p>
<p>Judges will review the Summaries as discussed in the &#x201C;Judging&#x201D;
section, above. The Summaries with the five (5) highest scores
will be selected as potentially winning Participants. In the
event of a tie ranking for two or more Summaries, the
Participant whose Summary had the highest ranking for &#x201C;Severity&#x201D;
will receive the higher prize. In the event of a second tie, the
Participant whose Summary had the highest ranking for &#x201C;Scope&#x201D;
will receive the higher prize. Odds of winning depend on the
number of eligible entries received and the skill of the
Participants.</p>
<p>The Judges are under no obligation to provide feedback on their
decisions or on their judgment on specific Exploits they
consider.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Team Winners</p>
<p>A special note about the prize distribution process for
Participants who are entering as part of a team:</p>
<p>A single member of each team shall be designated to receive the
prize, if any, awarded to such team at the initial registration
of the team, and Google shall have no responsibility for
distribution of the prize among the team members.</p>
<p>Each individual that enters as part of a team, understands and
agrees that if their team is selected to receive a prize, the
team is responsible for ensuring the funds are appropriately
distributed to each member of the team. In addition, once a team
has registered, the team may not add, remove, or substitute any
members or otherwise change the composition of the team for the
duration of the Contest. If any member of a team does not comply
with these Terms, is ineligible or is disqualified, the team as
a whole may be disqualified in Google&#x2019;s sole discretion.</p>

<li>All Participants will need to verify their identity with
Google, before receiving their prize; however, Participants
may provide an alias for use in any public documentation and
marketing material issued publicly by Google, subject to
limitations of the law and as required by law
enforcement. Please be aware that in some jurisdictions, a
list of winners must be made available and your name, and

Participant, or in the case of a team, any individual member
of the team, refuses or fails to provide the necessary
information to Google within 14 days of the Contest
administrators&#x2019; request for the required information, then
Google may, in its sole discretion, disqualify the

ranking. Google will not be held responsible for any failure
of potential winners to receive notification that they are
potential winners. Except where prohibited by law, each
potential winner may be required to sign and return a
Declaration of Eligibility, Liability &amp; Publicity Release
and Release of Rights and provide any additional information
that may be required by Google. If required, potential
winners must return all such required documents within 14
calendar days following attempted notification or such
potential winner will be deemed to have forfeited the prize
and Google will select the Participant with the next highest
overall ranking as the potential winner.</li>
<li>Prizes will be awarded within 6 months after the Contest End Date.</li>
<li>If fewer than 5 Participants or teams are found eligible,

responsibility of the participating team. Google will award the
prize only to the one (1) member of the team, who was identified
by the Participant to receive the prize as part of the
registration process. Google will attempt to reach only the
designated recipient for purposes of distribution of the prize.</p>
<p>Prizes are awarded without warranty of any kind from Google,
express or implied, without limitation, except where this would
be contrary to federal, state, provincial, or local laws or
regulations. All federal, state, provincial and local laws and
regulations apply.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Taxes</p>
<p>Payments to potential prize winners are subject to the express
requirement that they submit to Google all documentation
requested by Google to permit it to comply with all applicable
US, state, local and foreign (including provincial) tax
reporting and withholding requirements. All prizes will be net
of any taxes Google is required by law to withhold. All taxes
imposed on the prize are the sole responsibility of the prize
recipient.</p>
<p>In order to receive a prize, potential prize recipients must
submit the tax documentation requested by Google or otherwise
required by applicable law, to Google or the relevant tax
authority, all as determined by applicable law, including, where
relevant, the law of the potential prize recipient&#x2019;s country of
residence. The potential prize recipient is responsible for
ensuring that they comply with all the applicable tax laws
and filing requirements. If a potential prize recipient fails to
provide such documentation or comply with such laws, the prize
may be forfeited and Google may, in its sole discretion, select
an alternative potential prize recipient.</p>
