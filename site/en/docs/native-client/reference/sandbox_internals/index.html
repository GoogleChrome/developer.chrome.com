<p>The sandbox internals documentation describes implementation details for
Native Client sandboxing, which is also used by Portable Native
Client. These details can be useful to reimplement a sandbox, or to
write assembly code that follows sandboxing rules for Native Client
(Portable Native Client does not allow platform-specific assembly code).</p>
<p>As an implementation detail, the Native Client sandboxes described here
are currently used by Portable Native Client to execute code on the
corresponding machines in a safe manner. The portable bitcode contained
in a <strong>pexe</strong> is translated to a machine-specific <strong>nexe</strong> before
execution. This may change at a point in time: Portable Native Client
doesn&#x2019;t necessarily need these sandboxes to execute code on these
machines. Note that the Portable Native Client compiler itself is also
untrusted: it too runs in a Native Client sandbox described below.</p>
<p>Native Client has sandboxes for:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="/docs/native-client/reference/sandbox_internals/arm-32-bit-sandbox#arm-32-bit-sandbox"><em>ARM 32-bit</em></a>.</li>
<li>x86-32: the original design is described in <a class="reference external" href="http://research.google.com/pubs/archive/34913.pdf">Native Client: A Sandbox
for Portable, Untrusted x86 Native Code</a>, the current
design has changed slightly since then.</li>
