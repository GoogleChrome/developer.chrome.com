  A tutorial that teaches you how to use Yeoman, Gradle, and Grunt to build a web application.
---

**Note:** The steps described here don't work with the latest versions of Android Studio. This
document will be updated when a fix is available.

One of the great things with web development is the rich set of tools you can use to improve your
workflow.

An example of one of these tools is [Grunt][1], a JavaScript task runner that allows you to simply
define tasks to perform on your web app, from compiling Sass and starting a live server to
compressing images, minifying JavaScript and running JSHint before creating a production-ready
build.

[Yeoman][2] is a tool which helps create web applications, generating boilerplate, bringing in
libraries from [Bower][3] and [npm][4], and creating a Grunt file with predefined tasks.

In this tutorial you'll use Yeoman to create a new basic web application, then integrate the Android
Studio build system ([Gradle][5]) with Grunt, to build your web application. You'll also set up
Grunt tasks to launch a local live-reload server for testing your application in the browser, so you
don't have to manually refresh the page each time you change an HTML, CSS or JavaScript file.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, you'll need to install a few prerequisites:

1.  Install Yeoman: [https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Getting-Started][6]
2.  Install Android Studio: [http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html][7]

## Step 1. Create a new project in Android Studio with a WebView

You can find a full instructions on how to do this in the [Getting Started Guide][8].

## Step 2. Create a subdirectory in your Android Studio project for the web app content

After you've created your project, create a new top level directory:

- In Android Studio, right-click the project folder and selecting **New** > **Directory**.

  Name the directory `webapp`.

{% img src="image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/1604541811944.png",
       alt="Creating a new directory.",
       width="656",
       height="142" %}

## Step 3. Create a Yeoman project in your new directory

In a terminal `cd` to the the `webapp` directory in the project.

```bash
cd <path-to-project>/webapp/
```

Then create a new web app with Yeoman:

```bash
yo webapp
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to select project options.

You may need to run **`sudo npm install`** depending on how npm is installed on your machine.

Before proceeding to the next step, test the app by running the following command:

```bash
grunt server
```

A new tab should open in your browser, connecting to a local server started by Grunt. If you change
one of the HTML, CSS or JavaScript files in the project, the page automatically reloads and updates.
If you run `grunt build` a new directory, `dist`, is created and your web app is compressed,
optimised and made into a production ready version inside this folder.

## Step 4. Configure the Gradle build

In your `webapp` directory create a new file called `build.gradle`.

{% img src="image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/1604541870306.png",
       alt="Creating a new file.",
       width="656",
       height="166" %}

In your new `build.gradle` file, add the following:

```java
import org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.condition.Os

task buildWebApp(type: Exec) {

  executable = Os.isFamily(Os.FAMILY_WINDOWS) ? "grunt.cmd" : "grunt"

  args = ["build"]
}
```

This creates a new task called `buildWebApp` with a predefined type `Exec`. You then set the
`executable` variable in `Exec` to the relevant grunt command depending on the current OS. `args`
are set to `"build"` which equates to `grunt build` being run on the command line. Finally, the
import at the top is to make use of `Os.isFamily(Os.FAMILY_WINDOWS)`.

Before we can use this new task we need to make the project aware of the new `build.gradle` file.

Open `settings.gradle` in the root directory and add the following line:

```text
include ':webapp'
```

## Step 5. Build your WebApp when you build the android app

The final step is to get the web app to build and then copy the app into the `assets` directory of
our Android app.

Copy the following into the Android apps `build.gradle` file:

```text
task copyWebApplication(type: Copy) {
  from '../webapp/dist'
  into 'src/main/assets/www'
}

task deleteWebApplication(type: Delete) {
  delete 'src/main/assets/www'
}

copyWebApplication.dependsOn ':webapp:buildWebApp'
copyWebApplication.dependsOn deleteWebApplication

android.applicationVariants.all { variant ->
  tasks.getByPath(":${project.name}:assemble${variant.buildType.name.capitalize()}").dependsOn copyWebApplication
}
```

Let's examine each part of this.

### task copyWebApplication

```text
task copyWebApplication(type: Copy) {
  from '../webapp/dist'
  into 'src/main/assets/www'
}
```

This `Copy` task copies your application from the `webapp/dist` directory. We want to copy the files
to `src/main/assets/www`. This task also creates the necessary file structure if any of the required
directories don't exist.

### task deleteWebApplication

```text
task deleteWebApplication(type: Delete) {
  delete 'src/main/assets/www'
}
```

This delete task deletes all the files in the `assets/www` directory.

### copyWebApplication.dependsOn

```text
copyWebApplication.dependsOn ':webapp:buildWebApp'
copyWebApplication.dependsOn deleteWebApplication
```

The first line of this states that the `copyWebApplication` has a dependency on the `buildWebApp`
task from our web app's `build.gradle` file.

The second line states there is a dependency on the `deleteWebApplication` task.

In other words, before we actually copy any files to the `assets` directory, make sure we build the
web app and also delete the current contents of the `assets` directory.

### android.applicationVariants.all

```text
android.applicationVariants.all { variant ->
  tasks.getByPath(":${project.name}:assemble${variant.buildType.name.capitalize()}").dependsOn copyWebApplication
}
```

This task specifies the dependencies for all of your project's builds, for each version of your app.
Here it sets a dependency on the `assemble` tasks to run `copyWebApplication`.

The `assemble` tasks assembles the output of the project, so the web app needs to be copied over to
the Android project first.

## Step 6. Make sure everything works

In Android Studio, you should have no `assets` directory in your Android applications `src` folder.

Don't forget you'll need to set the WebView to use the `index.html` page:

`mWebView.loadUrl("file:///android_asset/www/index.html");`

**Note:** If your page uses JavaScript, you need to enable it explicitly. For details, see the
[Getting Started Guide][9].

Now press **Run** and let your application build. You should see an `assets` directory with your web
application in the `www` subdirectory.

## Step 7. What about live server and live reload?

So now you have a good build process for your Android application. But what about developing and
debugging the web content? Live reloading can be pretty useful for making quick changes.

To enable this, you can create two "product flavors" for your app, one a _live server version_ and
one a _static version_, where the web content is packaged into the Android application.

In your Android app's `build.gradle` add the following lines in bold at the end of the `android`
element:

```text
android {
  ...
  defaultConfig {
    ...
  }
  productFlavors {
    staticbuild {
      packageName "com.google.chrome.myapplication"
    }

    liveserver {
      packageName "com.google.chrome.myapplication.liveserver"
    }
  }

}
```

Gradle will now offer you the ability to create a version of your app with a liveserver package
name, and one with your normal package name. To check if it worked, click **Sync Project with Gradle
Files** (on the top bar next to the **Run** button).

{% img src="image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/1604541916467.png",
       alt="Sync Project With Gradle Files",
       width="656",
       height="156" %}

Then view the **Build Variants** which are in the bottom left corner of Android Studio and
essentially shows you what versions of your app you can build.

{% img src="image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/1604541989518.png", 
       alt="LiveserverDebug",
       width="656",
       height="540" %}

For each **_productFlavor_** there are **_Debug_** and **_Release_** versions, which the Android
plugin for Gradle gives you by default. This determines whether the build should be a debug build or
a release build suitable to deploy on the Play store.

Now you have two versions, but they don't actually do anything different yet.

## Step 8. Load from a live server

In this step, you'll configure your application to load a different URL depending on which product
flavor you build.

In your Android application, the files common to all product flavors are in `src/main`. To add code
or resources specific to one product flavor, you create another directory under `src` with the same
name as your **_productFlavor_**. When you build for that build variant, Gradle and the Android
plugin merge these additional files on top of the files in `src/main`.

In this case, you'll define the URL as a string resource, and use that resource in your code instead
of a hard-coded URL.

1.  Create the folders `src/liveserver` and `src/staticbuild`.

    {% img src="image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/1604542062720.png",
           alt="A screenshot of the directory hierarchy.",
           width="656",
           height="709" %}

2.  In the `liveserver` folder, create a new folder named `res` with a subfolder named `values`.
    Inside this create a file named `config.xml`. Repeat this process for the `staticbuild` folder.

    {% img src="image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/1604542103713.png",
           alt="Another screenshot of the directory hierarchy.",
           width="656",
           height="520" %}

3.  Now inside your config files add the following lines:

    `src/liveserver/res/values/config.xml`:

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <resources>
      <string name="init_url">http://<Your Local Machine IP Address>:9000</string>
    </resources>
    ```

    `src/staticbuild/res/values/config.xml`:

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <resources>
      <string name="init_url">file:///android_asset/www/index.html</string>
    </resources>
    ```

4.  Now set your WebView to use the `init_url` from these config files.

    ```java
    mWebView.loadUrl(getString(R.string.init_url));
    ```

5.  Create a new file called `AndroidManifest.xml` in `liveserver/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the
    following lines:

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
      <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
    </manifest>
    ```

    This adds the Internet permission for the `liveserver` builds.

6.  Finally, inside `webapp/Gruntfile.js` look for:

    ```js
    connect: {
      options: {
        port: 9000,
        livereload: 35729,
        // change this to '0.0.0.0' to access the server from outside
        hostname: **'localhost'**
      },
      ...
    }
    ```

    Replace `localhost` with `0.0.0.0` so your local server is accessible from the local network:

    ```js
    connect: {
      options: {
        port: 9000,
        livereload: 35729,
        // change this to '0.0.0.0' to access the server from outside
        hostname: '**0.0.0.0'**
      },
      ...
    }
    ```

To test your changes:

1.  Start the live server by running the following command:

    ```bash
    grunt server
    ```

2.  In Android Studio, in the **Build Variant** selection, select **LiveserverDebug**. Then click
    **Run**.

    You should be able to edit your HTML, CSS and JavaScript content and see it reflected
    immediately in the browser.

You now have two versions of your application: a development version with live reload from the Grunt
server; and a static version, packaged locally in the Android App.
