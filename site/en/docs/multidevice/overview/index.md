description: An overview of how you can run web content on different devices.
---

Google provides three ways to run web content on tablets, smartphones, and other devices:

- Using Chrome Mobile for devices running Android 4.0 and later, and iOS.
- With the default Android browser, for devices running versions of Android earlier than 4.0 (Ice
  Cream Sandwich).
- Within a [WebView][webview] in a native Android application.

The Google Chrome Mobile browser is based on the same code used by Chrome for Desktop. See the
following pages:

- [Chrome for Android][android]

## Getting started

- Visit [Google Play][chrome-google] to install Chrome for Android or the [App Store][chrome-apple]
  for Chrome for iOS.
- Read about [Chrome for Android features][android] to use in developing mobile web apps.
- Learn about developing applications in the [Chrome WebView for Android][webview].
- Learn how to debug mobile applications using [Chrome DevTools remote debugging][8]. Remote
  debugging works with Chrome for Android and the Chrome WebView.
- Emulate mobile device features using [Chrome DevTools mobile emulation][9].
