From Chrome Canary 98.0.4718.0, it's possible to debug the Protected Audience API and Protected Audience API
worklets in Chrome DevTools.

Read the [developer guide](/docs/privacy-sandbox/protected-audience-api/) for the full life cycle of the Protected Audience API.

[Protected Audience API overview](/docs/privacy-sandbox/protected-audience).

## Protected Audience API worklets {: #debugging }

The first step is to set breakpoints via a new category in the
**Event Listener Breakpoints** pane in the **Sources** panel.

%}

When a breakpoint triggers, execution is paused before the first statement at
the top-level of the worklet script. You can use regular breakpoints or step
commands to get to the bidding/scoring/reporting function itself.

Live worklet scripts will also show up under the Threads panel.

</figure>

Since some worklets may run in parallel, multiple threads may end up in the
"paused" state. You can use the thread list to switch between threads, and
resume or inspect them more closely as appropriate.

### Observe events

From the Application panel in Chrome DevTools, you can observe Protected Audience API interest
group and auction events.

If you visit the [Protected Audience API demo advertiser site](https://protected-audience-demo-advertiser.web.app/)
in a browser with the Protected Audience API enabled, DevTools will display information about the `join` event.

%}
</figure>

Now, if you visit the
[Protected Audience API demo publisher site](https://protected-audience-demo-publisher.web.app/)
in a browser with the Protected Audience API enabled, DevTools displays information about the `bid`
and `win` events.

{% Aside %}
You'll need to refresh the page to see Protected Audience API events if DevTools wasn't open
when you navigated to the site.
