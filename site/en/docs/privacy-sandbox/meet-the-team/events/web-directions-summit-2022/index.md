      When new CSS features collide: possibility and complexity at the
      intersections
    description: >-
      We finally got a proper layout system for the web, and each browser
      release seems to bring with it another new feature that promises more
      creative, performant, or intuitive CSS. Each new feature is exciting on
      its own, but where it gets really interesting is when we combine these
      things.

      In this talk I'll walk you through a recent history of CSS layout,
      demonstrating how thinking has evolved, and new features have become
      possible because of earlier decisions. You’ll discover the possibilities,
      and the complexity that lies at the intersections. Leave this talk with a
      deeper understanding of how CSS layout works, the inspiration to try
      combining different features, and a little peek at what might be around
      the corner.
    topics:
      - CSS
      - Web UI
      - Interop
