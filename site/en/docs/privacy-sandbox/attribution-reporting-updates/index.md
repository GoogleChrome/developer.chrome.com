The Attribution Reporting proposal [has changed](#changelog) to address
community feedback, from API mechanism changes to new functionality.

{% Partial 'privacy-sandbox/feedback-aside.njk' %}

## Who are these updates for?

These updates are for you if:

*  You're using the Attribution Reporting API in a demo or in experiments.

If you're new to this API or have not experimented with it yet, read the
[introduction to the Attribution Reporting API](/docs/privacy-sandbox/attribution-reporting-introduction/).
