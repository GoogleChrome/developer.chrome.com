<!-- noop -->
As part of its commitments to the CMA, Google has agreed to publicly provide
quarterly reports on the stakeholder engagement process for its Privacy Sandbox
proposals (refer to paragraphs 12 and 17(c)(ii) of [the
Commitments](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/62052c6a8fa8f510a204374a/100222_Appendix_1A_Google_s_final_commitments.pdf)).
These Privacy Sandbox feedback summary reports are generated by aggregating
feedback received by Chrome from the various sources as listed in the [feedback
overview](/docs/privacy-sandbox/feedback/), including but not limited to: GitHub
Issues, the feedback form made available on
[privacysandbox.com](https://privacysandbox.com/), meetings with industry
stakeholders, and web standards forums. Chrome welcomes the feedback received
from the ecosystem and is actively exploring ways to integrate learnings into
design decisions.

Feedback themes are ranked by prevalence per API. This is done by taking an
aggregation of the amount of feedback that the Chrome team has received around a
given theme and organizing in descending order of quantity. The common feedback
themes were identified by reviewing topics of discussion from public meetings
(W3C, PatCG, IETF), direct feedback, GitHub, and commonly asked questions
surfacing through Google's internal teams and public forms.

More specifically, meeting minutes for web standard bodies meetings were
reviewed and, for direct feedback, Google's records of 1:1 stakeholder meetings,
emails received by individual engineers, the API mailing list, and the public
feedback form were considered. Google then coordinated between the teams
involved in these various outreach activities to determine the relative
prevalence of the themes emerging in relation to each API.

The explanations of Chrome's responses to feedback were developed from published
FAQs, actual responses made to issues raised by stakeholders, and determining a
position specifically for the purposes of this public reporting exercise.
Reflecting the current focus of development and testing, questions and feedback
were received in particular with respect to Topics, FLEDGE, and Attribution
Reporting APIs. 

Feedback received after the end of the current reporting period may not yet have
a considered Chrome response.

Additionally, we have clarified timelines for certain features (such as 
FLEDGE event-level reporting, FLEDGE rendering with iframes) that
will not be impacted sooner than 2026.<br>
<br>
We encourage the ecosystem to test the APIs and provide feedback to
the CMA based on what testers expect to rely on once third-party
cookies are deprecated. This can contribute to their assessment of
the likely impact of third-party cookie deprecation.</td>

use. At the same time, Chrome is experimenting with showing updated
Privacy Sandbox ("Enhanced Ad Privacy") user controls to a very small
percentage of users, as part of our ongoing effort to improve the
Privacy Sandbox technologies. The updates include clearer, more
helpful language and layouts. Once Chrome has evaluated these
refinements and decided whether to expand them to a larger
population, they can share more information with the ecosystem.</td>

with that same ad tech (either with their worklets or their trusted
servers) or when explicitly shared by that ad tech (such as a buyer
shows a seller the ad URL they want to display). The one exception
being that the k-anonymity check must be done by a global centralized
server, which is an area we continue to devote significant resources
to. Refer to the <a

Beyond that, we are open to providing more details on how the ad-tech
protections employed in the design of the k-anonymity server work.

The Topics API will remain part of the collection of APIs that the
ads ecosystem should test during 2023 — and we hope the testing
feedback we hear and the implementer experience we gain will be
valuable contributions in future efforts towards cross-browser standards
work in this space. We look forward to continuing to engage with the
ecosystem on how to ease a possible transition where Topics API
could be an agreed-upon standard with cross-browser
compatibility.</td>

including region specific. </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Q1 Update: <br>
<br>
Improvements to the taxonomy are an ongoing effort, and in Q2 we will announce an updated taxonomy for the Topics API. To craft this new taxonomy, we worked closely with companies from across the ecosystem. 
<br>
We are actively seeking feedback on the taxonomy that would be  most useful for the ecosystem. In evaluating whether to expand the number of topics or include more granular topics, there are a few considerations including 1) potential privacy implications (more topics may introduce fingerprinting risk) and 2) ability to retrieve previously observed topics (such as with more topics, there may be less of a chance that an ad tech has seen the chosen topic in the past).

Impact on first-party signals</td>

first-party interest-based signals.</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">We believe interest-based advertising is an important use case for
the web, and Topics is designed to support that use case. We
understand that some large publishers are concerned that Topics will
negatively impact their first-party data strategies. We look forward
to ecosystem testing, which will provide insights into the impact
Topics has on publishers.</td>

      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Ads targeting when topics are miscategorized for a given site</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Q1 Update: <br>

In Q2 we will announce an updated classifier for the Topics API and look forward to engaging with the ecosystem on it. 
<br>
In response to the current feedback, sites are classified through a combination of a human-curated override list, containing the most popular sites, and an on-device ML model. Chrome continues to evaluate options for sites to contribute to Topics classification. Any utility improvements must be weighed against the privacy and abuse risks. For example, a few of the risks include: sites using self-labeling as a method to encode different (and potentially sensitive) meanings into topics; sites misrepresenting their topics for financial gain; sites attacking topics in order to blunt its usefulness for others (for example spamming the user's topics with meaningless noise).
The public can inspect these components, with tooling available via <code>chrome://topics-internals</code> or this <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hIVoz8bRCTpllYvads51MV7YS3zi3prn?usp=sharing">colab</a>. Through testing, we expect classification to improve over time, and we <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox/feedback/#feedback-routes">welcome feedback</a> of examples of sites that may be miscategorized.</td>

Topics" is returned to the caller for debugging purposes</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">We understand and appreciate that debugging tools are helpful to
developers, as they work to integrate Topics API into their systems.
However, by exposing additional information (such as the reason why
no Topics were returned), we may inadvertently share information that
enables parties to uncover additional details (for example, if a user is in
incognito mode, has disabled the API, and so forth) beyond what is intended,
harming user privacy. While we don't plan to provide additional
debugging tools at this time, we are open to feedback about which
tools would be valuable.</td>

reports and summary reports. Event-level reports do contain an
ad-tech provided event-ID that could be used in a data cleanroom, but
the conversion-side information associated will be limited and noisy.
Encrypted aggregatable reports cannot be used directly in a clean

protect user privacy, the number of contributions which can be

When you sum all aggregatable values across all aggregation keys, the
sum must be less than the contribution budget.<br>
<br>
Under the current design, we set a limit on the contributions for a
particular reporting origin over the last ~24 hours (as a rolling
window). That's the L1 contribution budget mentioned in the feedback.
We do suggest that developers scale the values they contribute based
on expected volume (that is, not just using a value of 1). So, it might
make sense to use a smaller value for the more common events to avoid
exhausting the budget.<br>
<br>
We're currently seeking some feedback on the Private Aggregation
API's <a

budget</a> on both the numeric bound and the scope. We are
considering moving the scope from per-origin to per-site and moving

      <td style="vertical-align: top;">At this time, we are preparing to ship First-party Sets (FPS) in Chrome, and have set up
a centralized GitHub repository to accept set submissions. Since we
hope that FPS will fill a gap with existing web platform solutions
in preparation for third-party cookie deprecation, we expect to learn
from them how FPS is leveraged by site authors. As the list of sets
grows over time, and the ecosystem adapts to a post third-party
cookie world, we can also mature the process to the point where we
can consider alternative decentralized schemes such as the one
proposed. With the current process, we expect to institute set
lifetimes, which will allow us to evolve the intake process over
time. We can revisit this idea once the submission process
matures.</td>

also be embedded as a script instead of an iframe, which does not
switch the browsing context, and the third-party can write to the

sufficient need and there is existing technology we can build upon to
introduce the capability to the web, while preserving user privacy.
For example, device and boot integrity was highly ranked and many
platforms have existing APIs that securely share an assessment of
device integrity, so it is a good candidate to <a

exploration</a> within the community groups.</td>

issues</a> with specific details and an update to our launch plan (in
progress, as of publication of this feedback report).<br>
<br>
For the larger changes to the API, we are open to considering them,
but we feel the best way forward is to proceed with launch to general
availability and get hands-on feedback from more developers. We hope
to continue this discussion and pursue browser standardization. If
and when a new standard would emerge, we will consider adopting and
developing a plan to carefully transition to it.</td>
