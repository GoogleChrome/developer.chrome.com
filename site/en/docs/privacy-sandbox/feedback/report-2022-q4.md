  Quarterly report for 2022 Q4 summarising the ecosystem feedback received on
  Privacy Sandbox proposals and Chrome's response.

As part of its commitments to the CMA, Google has agreed to publicly provide
quarterly reports on the stakeholder engagement process for its Privacy Sandbox
proposals (see paragraphs 12 and 17(c)(ii) of [the
Commitments](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/62052c6a8fa8f510a204374a/100222_Appendix_1A_Google_s_final_commitments.pdf)).
These Privacy Sandbox feedback summary reports are generated by aggregating
feedback received by Chrome from the various sources as listed in the [feedback
overview](/docs/privacy-sandbox/feedback/), including but not limited to: GitHub
Issues, the feedback form made available on
[privacysandbox.com](https://privacysandbox.com/), meetings with industry
stakeholders, and web standards forums. Chrome welcomes the feedback received
from the ecosystem and is actively exploring ways to integrate learnings into
design decisions.

Feedback themes are ranked by prevalence per API. This is done by taking an
aggregation of the amount of feedback that the Chrome team has received around a
given theme and organizing in descending order of quantity. The common feedback
themes were identified by reviewing topics of discussion from public meetings
(W3C, PatCG, IETF), direct feedback, GitHub, and commonly asked questions
surfacing through Google’s internal teams and public forms.

More specifically, meeting minutes for web standard bodies meetings were
reviewed and, for direct feedback, Google’s records of 1:1 stakeholder meetings,
emails received by individual engineers, the API mailing list, and the public
feedback form were considered. Google then coordinated between the teams
involved in these various outreach activities to determine the relative
prevalence of the themes emerging in relation to each API.

The explanations of Chrome’s responses to feedback were developed from published
FAQs, actual responses made to issues raised by stakeholders, and determining a
position specifically for the purposes of this public reporting exercise.
Reflecting the current focus of development and testing, questions and feedback
were received in particular with respect to Topics, Fledge and Attribution
Reporting APIs. 

Feedback received after the end of the current reporting period may not yet have
a considered Chrome response.

      <td>Our response is unchanged from Q3:<br>
<br>
<em>"Google has committed to the CMA to design and implement the Privacy Sandbox proposals in a way that does not distort competition by self-preferencing Google's own business, and to take into account impact on competition in digital advertising and on publishers and advertisers, regardless of their size. We continue to work closely with the CMA to ensure that our work complies with these commitments.</em><br>
<br>
<em>As testing of the Privacy Sandbox progresses, one of the key questions we will assess is how the new technologies perform for different types of stakeholders. Feedback is critical in this respect, especially specific and actionable feedback that can help us further improve the technical designs.</em><br>

      <td>Q4 Update:<br>
<br>
We appreciate that developers have found our current material helpful, and continue to be committed to providing more material so developers can understand how the new technologies can work for them. Over the past quarter, we added a "News & Updates" section to <a href="http://privacysandbox.com">privacysandbox.com</a> and published an extensive review of how the Privacy Sandbox can help drive ad relevance in the future.<br>
<br>
We've also held public developer office hours sessions to share best practices and demos, along with Q&A sessions with product and engineering leads to allow for live discussion/questions.</td>

      <td>Keeping latency to a minimum is a key design goal of the Privacy Sandbox APIs. Our current expectation is that API latency should have minimal impact on a site's Core Web Vitals, as the majority of APIs are called after the initial rendering of the website. We continue to monitor and make improvements to reduce latency further for each of the APIs, and encourage continued testing and feedback.<br>
<br>
Latency in the real time bidding process is addressed in the FLEDGE section under "Performance of FLEDGE Auctions"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Interoperability</td>
      <td>Concerns regarding interoperability with other potential solutions</td>
      <td>The goal of Privacy Sandbox is to protect users against cross-site tracking while supporting the needs of the web ecosystem. We seek to accomplish this by moving away from legacy browser technologies that enable such cross-site tracking, like third-party cookies, and providing in their place new technologies purpose-built to support specific use cases. <br>
<br>
The Privacy Sandbox proposals improve privacy by limiting the data that leaves a user's device. The proposals do not place technical restrictions on a website's ability to share or otherwise process data once collected from the browser. The technologies therefore do not prevent companies from entering into "data stewardship" agreements or any other similar contractual relationship. Likewise, they do not restrict the ability of users to consent to sharing their data via other means. <br>
<br>
For clarity, Google has committed to apply the Privacy Sandbox technologies in the same way to all websites, including Google products and services. After Chrome ends support for third-party cookies, the commitments also make clear that Google will not use other personal data, such as users' synced Chrome browsing history, to track users for the targeting or measurement of digital advertising.</td>

Chrome continues to evaluate options for considering page level metadata (such as all or some components of the page URL and/or content) in Topics classification. Any utility improvements must be weighed against the privacy and abuse risks.<br>
<br>
For example, with respect to metadata in particular, a few of the risks include:<br>
- Sites modifying page-level metadata as a method to encode different (and potentially sensitive) meanings into topics;<br>
- Sites modifying page-level metadata to misrepresent their topics for financial gain;<br>

<br>
<em>"We believe interest-based advertising is an important use case for the web, and Topics is designed to support that use case. As described [in our Q3 report], other ecosystem stakeholders have expressed concerns that Topics may not be useful enough to provide value.

<br>
To explain, the Topics API classification has two relevant components: (1) An override list containing the top 10k sites and their topics, and (2) an on-device ML model that classifies hostnames into topics. By expanding the override list (1), we can improve performance of classification for those regions in which the classifier may be performing poorly.</td>

      <td>Topics/Privacy Sandbox appears to be an industry focused approach. Benefit for users is not as clear as benefit to industry.</td>

Removing third-party cookies without viable alternatives may negatively impact publishers, and could lead to worse approaches<br>
 which are less private, are not transparent, and are not realistically resettable or controlled by users. Many companies are actively testing Topics and Sandbox APIs, and we're committed to providing the tools to advance privacy and support the web.<br>
<br>
<br>
The W3C Technical Architecture Group has recently published its <a href="https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/726">initial view</a> about the Topics API, which we will be responding to publicly. At this stage, since Google has received questions from the ecosystem about what this review may imply for the development and launch of the Topics API, we would like to reaffirm our plan to make it available in Chrome Stable this year. While Googles appreciates the input of the W3C Technical Architecture Group, it considers it of paramount importance to continue the efforts to develop and test Topics in consultation with the CMA and the ecosystem. </td>

<br>
Other parts of the Privacy Sandbox already support mitigations to cover tracking (see UA-CH, IP Protection, and Bounce Tracking Mitigations) and will continue to improve over time.

      <td>In addition to the feedback provided by the ecosystem on the proposal to adopt "GDPR Validated Sets," Chrome has concerns about the following limitations of this alternative proposal:<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>"GDPR Validated Sets" claims to "align to" GDPR (although it is not really clear what is meant by that). In contrast, Google's commitments require it to take into account "impact on privacy outcomes" more generally. In its decision accepting the commitments the CMA points out that this is distinct from Google's obligation to take into account "compliance with data protection principles as set out in the Applicable Data Protection Legislation," which, as the CMA explains, reflects the fact that Google is bound by the Applicable Data Protection Legislation, both as it applies to the commitments and more generally.<br>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We have privacy concerns about the proposal to allow domains to appear in multiple sets. First-Party Sets are intended to support specific use cases that currently depend on third-party cookies without enabling pervasive cross-site tracking. Allowing domains to join multiple sets would remove a key privacy protection built into the First-Party Sets proposal, without introducing any other meaningful limitations.<br>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>GDPR Validated Sets also proposes to "define a Set as a group of data controllers and processors that share a common use policy." This is similar to the requirement in our original First-Party Sets proposal that all parties in a set must share a common privacy policy. We have since removed that requirement based on strong feedback from the ecosystem raising concerns about privacy policy-based requirements. For example, we heard from site publishers that maintaining a common privacy policy was infeasible because of product and geographical variations, among other challenges raised by members of the W3C community (<a href="https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/93#issuecomment-1357694422">1</a>,<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/WICG/first-party-sets/issues/48&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1674574967860008&usg=AOvVaw1g-YA8v1Z26oFXE5djsGiC"> 2</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/WICG/first-party-sets/issues/75&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1674574967859841&usg=AOvVaw3EJFbjV4U9Vbbz4xs2zr2j">3</a>). We believe that the same challenges would apply to this proposal.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Since this alternative was raised, Chrome has updated the <a href="https://github.com/WICG/first-party-sets">First-Party Sets proposal</a> and published <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/first-party-sets/blob/main/FPS-Submission_Guidelines.md">submission guidelines</a> for creating new sets. </td>

<br>
It appears that concerns regarding the user-RP relationship and "interoperability" owe to a misunderstanding of the FedCM proposal. FedCM leaves it to IdPs to decide what information to share with an RP, and in what form, once the user has chosen to sign in to that RP's site. FedCM does not require IdPs to "create a unique pseudonymous identifier for each [RP] with whom the user authenticates." Rather, FedCM is open for each IdP to choose whether to share the user's actual identifier, a per-site version of that identifier, or some other version of this information. <br>

(The FedCM specification does identify <a href="https://fedidcg.github.io/FedCM/#attack-scenarios-by-rp-cross-site-correlation">cross-site correlation</a> as a privacy risk associated with the API and discusses directed (per-site) identifiers as a possible mitigation. However, the decision whether to use directed identifiers is left to IdPs, not imposed by the browser.)<br>
<br>
FedCM also already provides for user choice with respect to identity. For example, if a user has multiple identities with the same IdP (e.g., a work profile and a personal profile), FedCM provides a way for the user to select which one they want to use to log in to the RP's site. Beyond that, each RP decides for itself which IdPs to support on its site. One aspect of that decision is considering the mechanism that an IdP relies on, whether that's FedCM or a different technology. Again, the browser does not dictate these choices for RPs or IdPs.</td>
