<!-- noop -->
As part of its commitments to the CMA, Google has agreed to publicly provide
quarterly reports on the stakeholder engagement process for its Privacy Sandbox
proposals (refer to paragraphs 12 and 17(c)(ii) of [the
Commitments](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/62052c6a8fa8f510a204374a/100222_Appendix_1A_Google_s_final_commitments.pdf)).
These Privacy Sandbox feedback summary reports are generated by aggregating
feedback received by Chrome from the various sources as listed in the [feedback
overview](/docs/privacy-sandbox/feedback/), including but not limited to: GitHub
Issues, the feedback form made available on
[privacysandbox.com](https://privacysandbox.com/), meetings with industry
stakeholders, and web standards forums. Chrome welcomes the feedback received
from the ecosystem and is actively exploring ways to integrate learnings into
design decisions.

Feedback themes are ranked by prevalence per API. This is done by taking an
aggregation of the amount of feedback that the Chrome team has received around a
given theme and organizing in descending order of quantity. The common feedback
themes were identified by reviewing topics of discussion from public meetings
(W3C, PatCG, IETF), direct feedback, GitHub, and commonly asked questions
surfacing through Google's internal teams and public forms.

More specifically, meeting minutes for web standard bodies meetings were
reviewed and, for direct feedback, Google's records of 1:1 stakeholder meetings,
emails received by individual engineers, the API mailing list, and the public
feedback form were considered. Google then coordinated between the teams
involved in these various outreach activities to determine the relative
prevalence of the themes emerging in relation to each API.

The explanations of Chrome's responses to feedback were developed from published
FAQs, actual responses made to issues raised by stakeholders, and determining a
position specifically for the purposes of this public reporting exercise.
Reflecting the current focus of development and testing, questions and feedback
were received in particular with respect to Topics, Protected Audience, and Attribution
Reporting APIs. 

Feedback received after the end of the current reporting period may not yet have
a considered Chrome response.

with sequencing leading to a second half of 2024 readiness. Privacy
Sandbox will publish more detailed information on the sequencing of
ramping up 3PCD. Under the Commitments, 3PCD is subject to the CMA's
competition concerns being addressed.</td>

Protected Audience API integration do not include supporting Google's
publisher ad server without control of the top-level auction. </td>

Ad Manager's public documentation</a> says that the winner of the
contextual auction is passed to the top-level scoring logic and not
to any component auction, including AdX or Open Bidding. <br>
Furthermore, that documentation says of the top-level scoring logic:
"Ad Manager will compare the winning bid of each component auction,
including Ad Manager's own component auction for interest group bids
of its buyers, as well as the best contextual ad (which is selected
via dynamic allocation), and will serve the ad with the highest bid."</td>

      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Can agencies or companies without JavaScript on websites use Privacy
Sandbox APIs?</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Anyone can call the Privacy Sandbox APIs. If an agency or anyone else
wants to build technologies directly on the APIs they can.
Client-side APIs require integrating with the client, just as cookies
do. Many of the APIs, like cookies, also have an HTTP header
interface. We've already seen one ad industry framework, Prebid,
build client-side integrations with the APIs. Other organizations
could do the same.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Client-side Solutions</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Why is Google adopting client-side solutions for Privacy Sandbox when
an engineer has previously expressed concern on the scalability of
such solutions in 2012?</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Privacy-enhancing technology (PET) as a field of study has evolved
significantly since 2012 and, with it, commercially viable
applications. At the core of Privacy Sandbox are combinations of PETs
which wouldn't have been feasible over a decade ago. In addition,
personal computing power has increased, as have consumer expectations
of browsers and regulatory expectations of privacy.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Machine Learning</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">What is Google's planned usage of Privacy Sandbox for machine
learning purposes?</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Much of the ad tech ecosystem uses machine learning today and we do
not expect that to change. Privacy Sandbox does not prevent ad tech
companies or anyone else from continuing to use machine learning. Nor
does Privacy Sandbox require that companies integrating with its APIs
use machine learning. It is reasonable to expect that companies will
continue building products and services in ways that meet the needs
of their customers, whether that includes machine learning or not.
Any machine learning that Privacy Sandbox integrators do build will
obviously be known to them and thus not be obscured to them.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Data verification</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">How can companies verify that the data they receive from using the
Privacy Sandbox is accurate and is Google willing to be reviewed via
an entity such as the Media Ratings Council (MRC)?</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Privacy Sandbox APIs are built within the open-source platform that
powers Chrome. The portions of the APIs meant to run in Trusted
Execution Environments are also open source and auditable. Anyone who
wants to inspect the code can, including MRC.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">(Also reported in previous quarters) Production Support</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">What is the process in place for Chrome to support Privacy Sandbox
technical issues and escalations affecting the ecosystem?</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Google provides a range of channels to allow ad techs to report
technical issues and enable any necessary escalations to resolve such
issues. In addition, Chrome expects to further build and scale a
process to resolve technical issues and escalations affecting the
health of the ecosystem. Chrome is committed to ensuring resources
for this effort. <br>
Please see our <a

      <td style="vertical-align: top;">More information about the timelines and exact implementations for
the Chrome-facilitated testing modes.</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">We have shared a <a
href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox/chrome-testing/">blog post</a>
about testing modes and are working to share more information soon.<br>
We are <a
href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox/chrome-testing/">welcoming suggestions</a> for what size the testing mode labels
should be.</td>

      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Integration with other industry standards</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Will the Privacy Sandbox APIs connect to either or both TCF v2.* and
Consent Mode?</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">We do not have plans to integrate Privacy Sandbox APIs directly with
TCF v2 or Consent Mode. However, companies and industry trade groups
are welcome to adapt their products and frameworks to work in
conjunction with Privacy Sandbox APIs. For example, with frameworks
like TCF, each participant must determine its own compliance approach
based on the TCF signal it receives and the associated TCF policies.
We expect companies to determine when and how to use various
functionality our Privacy Sandbox building blocks offer.</td>

## Enrollment & Attestation

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Restriction</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Enrollment process means Google can decide which company in the
ecosystem is allowed to use Privacy Sandbox APIs.</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">The Enrollment and Attestation process essentially entails
verification of the entity (for example, the entity has a DUNs number, can
provide a link to a privacy policy, and so forth) and makes the public
attestation a requirement for calling the APIs. Entities that can
successfully fulfill the enrollment requirements will be validated.
For companies that do not have a DUNs, we are providing an expedited,
complimentary process with Dun & Bradstreet to acquire one. The
objective is to enhance privacy protections of the APIs (by the
measures just mentioned) and also to add a layer of transparency to
the Privacy Sandbox APIs, so interested parties can better understand who is using
which API and what attestations they are making. We are open to
further industry feedback on this issue, which has already been used
to shape the process.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Re-enrollment overhead</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Attestation file expires every 12 months and requires websites to
re-enroll.</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">We've heard feedback from the ecosystem and amended our approach
accordingly. This means that files will no longer expire after 12
months or any set period of time. We are updating our enrollment
developer guide with additional context.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Attestation file</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">How is the attestation file used?</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">All companies calling relevance and measurement APIs will be required
by the enforcement deadline to upload the attestation file on their
site and keep it for public view as long as you are intending to
continue calling the APIs.<br>
<br>
Websites could expect approximately one request per hour from Privacy
Sandbox, and other potential entities may query as well. This will
be conducted via the enrollment system's own mechanism to query
enrolled entities' servers and ensure the attestation file is valid.
<br>
<br>
Attestations will be included in Transparency Reports and viewable by
the general public. We expect companies to act in accordance with
their stated attestations, as will the rest of the ecosystem and
relevant regulatory bodies.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Enrollment</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Is enrollment per site or per origin?</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Enrollment is at the site level.</td>

      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Performance concerns on the impact of Topics opt-in rate in the
European Economic Area.</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">We would suggest to concerned stakeholders to contact your relevant
Data Protection Authority about this issue. They are best placed to
address such concerns and influence whether applications of
privacy-enhancing technologies are incentivized by laws or instead
treated like tracking, requiring the same approaches to consent. The
latter could result in APIs like those in Privacy Sandbox not being
available as often.</td>

      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Do downstream bidders need to enroll in Topics API to use Topics
signals from upstream SSPs?</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">The downstream receivers of topics beyond the initial Topics API
caller do not need to be enrolled, though many are likely to be
enrolled for other API usage. A list of Privacy Sandbox enrollees
will be provided programmatically as part of the program's
transparency efforts, which would allow an interested caller of the
Topics API to check if the recipient they are sending a topic to is
enrolled, if the caller should want to.</td>

      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Site exclusion</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Exclude websites from contributing to a user's Topics.</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Topics are not called by default. It's important to note that no page
content is taken into account when topics are selected, and all
topics are curated to make sure they are not sensitive. A website can
also restrict their site from being included in topic calculation via
the following permission policy header: <code>Permissions-Policy:
browsing-topics=()</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Topics observation</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Allow publishers to give permissions for Chrome to classify topics
based on page content (for example, head or body).</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">We previously considered offering functionality to classify sites
into topics based on page content, and made the decision not to move
forward based on privacy and security concerns. This proposal may
mitigate some of those concerns, but it's unclear as to what extent. Due
to the upcoming CMA experiment period, we don't expect this change to
occur before 3PCD. We <a

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Topics observation</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Provide more fine-grained permission policies for publishers.</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Providing more
fine-grained permission policies for publishers would enable
publisher sites to negatively impact the utility of the Topics API
for the ecosystem as a whole, without it negatively impacting the
utility of the Topics API for the site itself. Refer to the <a
href="https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/topics/issues/92">Update permissions policy to support separate permissions for retrieve and observe</a> GitHub issue for a more detailed discussion of the topic.</td>

      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Why does the Topics taxonomy not cover topics in Medical or Health
categories?</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Medical and health categories are considered sensitive topics and
thus excluded from the Topics taxonomy.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Topics retrieval</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Faster way for DSPs to get Topics without fetching using
headers.</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">The header methods are more performant and less costly than creating
a cross-origin iframe and making a <code>document.browsingTopics()</code> call
from it. (A cross-origin iframe must be used for the call, because
the top-level context to observe a topic must match the context from
which topics are accessed.) This was <a
href="https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/topics/issues/7">discussed in detail here</a>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Topics retrieval</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Requests to support passing Topics via headers on cross-origin script
tag requests.</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">From a security perspective, this isn't possible. Each document and
its execution environment are associated with a single origin–that
of the document. Third-party subresources loaded and executed within
that same environment are considered to be owned by the origin of the
document. This is to prevent unconsented data leakage from one origin
to another.<br>
<br>
An alternative is to provide a <code>browsingTopics</code> attribute on <code>&lt;script></code>
tags. This should be clean from a security perspective, and not add
additional latency. We are open to <a
href="https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/topics/issues/239">
feedback</a> from interested parties.</td>

<br>
<br>
Going forward, we'll continue supporting ecosystem understanding of
the API and we look forward to hearing views from stakeholders. In
the meantime, we suggest stakeholders wanting to know more about the
Topics API familiarize themselves with the documentation in the

      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Usefulness for different types of stakeholders</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Smaller ad tech companies may not be able to observe Topics due to
the way browsers calculate them.</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Only ad techs that observed the user visit a page about the topic in
question within the past three weeks will receive a topic. If the ad
tech did not call the API in the previous three weeks for that user
on a site about that topic, then the returned value will be
empty.<br>
<br>
This feature means that ad techs whose services are used by a larger
number of site owners, and therefore have more opportunities to
observe a site visit by a given user, may receive more topics than
other ad techs. This feature is essential for the privacy protections
of the API as it limits the availability of information about a user
to only those parties who are already able to observe the same
underlying information (currently via third-party cookies).</td>

    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">XHR Request</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">When will Topics inclusion in <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> (XHR) requests be
deprecated?</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">As Chrome <a
href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/topics-api-announce/c/5QPSa2moCAY">announced
in August 2023</a>, Chrome began deprecating support for XHR when
transitioning from Origin Trial to General Availability.<br>
<br>
As the ramp-up of Topics progressed, XHR support was only included
for users for whom the OT features were enabled and was fully
deprecated when the individual OT experiment groups were merged.<br>
<br>
If you were using Topics with XHR, your sites will not break. The
topics just won't be added to your XHR request headers. We recommend
that you either transition to <code>fetch</code> for your request, use the iframe
attribute, or use the JavaScript API to retrieve topics. Fetch is
supported by all modern browsers, but not Internet Explorer or Opera
Mini.</td>

Google Ad Manager control of the top-level Protected Audience API
auction.</td>
      <td id="ad-manager" style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Response provided by Google Ad Manager:</strong><br>
Google Ad Manager's plans for the Protected Audience API do not include supporting Google's
publisher ad server without the control of the top-level Protected Audience auction,
for the following reasons. <br>
<br>
In order to properly serve our customers in the publisher ad serving
market, Google's publisher ad server needs to retain control of the
top-level Protected Audience auction. As a publisher ad server, our role is to
provide publishers forecasting so they can negotiate direct sold
campaigns without overbooking, and to pace and deliver their direct
reservations optimally. Doing this requires running the final auction
to compare all eligible direct and indirect demand.<br>
<br>
Forecasting and pacing are core functionalities that publishers expect
from an ad server. Without accurate forecasting, publishers may end
up overselling their inventory, which puts their business reputation
at risk. Pacing is also critical, as being unable to fulfill
reservation contracts with advertisers also risks damage to the
publisher-advertiser direct relationship, which could result in
significant impact to a publishers business.<br>
<br>
In short, therefore, we do not view a publisher ad server's activity
of running the top-level Protected Audience auction as distinct from the other
activities of the publisher ad server.</td>

      <td style="vertical-align: top;"><code>directFrom<br>SellerSignals</code><br>allows Google Ad Manager to prevent the
publisher from seeing the price of its contextual auction.</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Chrome response:</strong><br>
Information passed into <code>runAdAuction()</code> is not known to come from the
seller unless the seller calls <code>runAdAuction()</code> from its own iframe. In
a multi-seller auction it becomes impossible to have all sellers
create the frame calling <code>runAdAuction()</code>. <code>directFromSellerSignals</code>
addressed this issue by loading content from a subresource bundle
loaded from a seller's origin. This ensures that the authenticity and
integrity of information passed into an auction from the
seller-auctions configurations cannot be manipulated. If publishers
want to use Protected Audience API to understand any of the
information their technology providers are passing into Protected
Audience auctions, they can ask those technology providers for this
functionality.<br>
<br>
<strong>Response provided by Google Ad Manager:</strong><br>
We have maintained a strong focus on auction fairness for years,
including our promise that no price from any of a publisher's
non-guaranteed advertising sources, including non-guaranteed line
item prices, will be shared with another buyer before they bid in the
auction, which we then later reaffirmed in our <a
href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/some-changes-our-ad-technology/">commitments
to the French Competition Authority</a>.<br>
<br>
For Protected Audience auctions, we intend to keep our promise by leveraging
<code>directFromSellerSignals</code>, and not share the bid of any auction
participant with any other auction participant prior to completion of
the auction in multi-seller auctions. To be clear, we won't share the
price of the contextual auction with our own component auction
either, as explained in the <a
href="https://github.com/google/ads-privacy/commit/cd5d7c5336a5ce9f6c22776b4532ccd529c55210">Further clarify top-level auction dynamics</a> update.</td>

      <td style="vertical-align: top;">The person using a web browser can see everything that is happening
in the browser. When an ad auction happens inside the browser, it is
true that the person whose browser it is could watch that auction
take place, including seeing how much different parties choose to
bid. Since a browser is the user's agent, we do not think it is
possible or desirable to try to change this. Only the person using
the browser has visibility into these operations, however. An
on-device auction run using the Protected Audience API is not
observable to any servers, including Google's.</td>

Privacy Sandbox's mandatory attestation that API users will not try

attack.</td>

      <td style="vertical-align: top;">On questions of latency, the Protected Audience API has generally
followed the existing standard paradigm of building controls that let
sellers decide how much time and resources the bidders can consume,
and building tools that let buyers decide how to best use the
resources available to them. These controls and tools are generally
available today, but their full benefit will only be realized after
adoption by buyers and sellers. In addition, Chrome continues to work
on a variety of infrastructure improvements to auction speed (<a

days, and the rotation happens every 7 days; the TTL is also the same
for private keys in the case of the Aggregation Service. In case of
Bidding and Auction services, private and public keys are fetched
every N hours in the non-request path and cached in-memory, so that
there is no more than an N-hour delay between keys rotating and
servers picking up these keys. The 1-day buffer between key rotation
and expiry is to ensure that even if the key generation fails, the
services can continue operating. We are considering extending the TTL
to be more resilient for outages. In case of a key leak, we plan to
manually force key generation and invalidate keys sooner. Note that
public keys are cached on the clients, currently for 24 hours, again
to ensure that in case of coordinator outage, the services can still
operate.</td>

the response back from the origin, the second hop is able to forward
the response to the first hop proxy+port associated with the request
and doesn't need to learn anything about the original client IP (and
the first hop just returns the response to the client, without

be changed?</td>

domain must serve a JSON file at

associated domain limit to five domains following feedback from the
ecosystem. We have decided to increase the associated domain limit to
five domains (plus one primary domain) which best matches the most
comparable implementation offered by another major browser.</td>

      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Per the <a
href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/first-party-sets/blob/main/FPS-Submission_Guidelines.md)">submission
guides</a>, anyone can submit a PR on GitHub to edit the
<code>first_party_sets.JSON</code> file. However, if the PR is approved (passes
technical validations, and so forth), it will be manually merged in batches
to the canonical FPS list once per week (Tuesdays at 12pm Eastern
Time) by Google.<br>
<br>
If a bad actor tries to modify a set they don't own, it shouldn't be
a problem since they won't be able to modify the <code>.well-known</code> files
and therefore the validations will fail.</td>
