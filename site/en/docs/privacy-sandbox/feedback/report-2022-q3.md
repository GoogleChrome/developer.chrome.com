  Quarterly report for 2022 Q3 summarising the ecosystem feedback received on
  Privacy Sandbox proposals and Chrome's response.

As part of its commitments to the CMA, Google has agreed to publicly provide
quarterly reports on the stakeholder engagement process for its Privacy Sandbox
proposals (see paragraphs 12 and 17(c)(ii) of [the
Commitments](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/62052c6a8fa8f510a204374a/100222_Appendix_1A_Google_s_final_commitments.pdf)).
These Privacy Sandbox feedback summary reports are generated by aggregating
feedback received by Chrome from the various sources as listed in the [feedback
overview](/docs/privacy-sandbox/feedback/), including but not limited to: GitHub
Issues, the feedback form made available on
[privacysandbox.com](https://privacysandbox.com/), meetings with industry
stakeholders, and web standards forums. Chrome welcomes the feedback received
from the ecosystem and is actively exploring ways to integrate learnings into
design decisions.

Feedback themes are ranked by prevalence per API. This is done by taking an
aggregation of the amount of feedback that the Chrome team has received around a
given theme and organizing in descending order of quantity. The common feedback
themes were identified by reviewing topics of discussion from public meetings
(W3C, PatCG, IETF), direct feedback, GitHub, and commonly asked questions
surfacing through Google’s internal teams and public forms.

More specifically, meeting minutes for web standard bodies meetings were
reviewed and, for direct feedback, Google’s records of 1:1 stakeholder meetings,
emails received by individual engineers, the API mailing list, and the public
feedback form were considered. Google then coordinated between the teams
involved in these various outreach activities to determine the relative
prevalence of the themes emerging in relation to each API.

The explanations of Chrome’s responses to feedback were developed from published
FAQs, actual responses made to issues raised by stakeholders, and determining a
position specifically for the purposes of this public reporting exercise.
Reflecting the current focus of development and testing, questions and feedback
were received in particular with respect to Topics, Fledge and Attribution
Reporting APIs. 

Feedback received after the end of the current reporting period may not yet have
a considered Chrome response.

<p>
Google has committed to the CMA to design and implement the Privacy Sandbox proposals in a way that does not distort competition by self-preferencing Google’s own business, and to take into account impact on competition in digital advertising and on publishers and advertisers, regardless of their size. We continue to work closely with the CMA to ensure that our work complies with these commitments. 
<p>
As testing of the Privacy Sandbox progresses, one of the key questions we will assess is how the new technologies perform for different types of stakeholders. <a href="/docs/privacy-sandbox/feedback/">Feedback</a> is critical in this respect, especially specific and actionable feedback that can help us further improve the technical designs. 
<p>
We have worked with the CMA to develop our approach to quantitative testing, and are supportive of the CMA publishing a note on experiment design to provide more information to market participants and an opportunity to comment on the proposed approaches.

   <td>Concerns have been raised about the usefulness for sites depending on their level of traffic or how specialized their content is.
   </td>
   <td><em>Q3 Update:</em>
<p>
The usefulness of the API will be explored through testing. As required under paragraph 17.c.ii of the Commitments, Google will share with the CMA the results of such tests. Chrome expects the taxonomy and other parameters to evolve based on testing results. The evolution of the taxonomy or parameters may not require backwards incompatible changes. Further, Chrome expects feedback to continue influencing the Topics API evolution after third-party cookie deprecation.

   </td>
   <td>Request to remove per-caller topic filtering requirement.
   </td>
   <td>Based on feedback from privacy KOFs, privacy advocates, security experts, digital rights groups, and others in the ecosystem, Chrome chose this design to give access to information only to those that otherwise had such access. The reasons for this included, but were not limited to, limiting incremental cross-side data leakage; ensuring transparency and explainability; adopting an approach that is simple to implement and describe; and limiting the risk of fingerprinting. Publishers and third parties that receive Topics could decide for themselves what information they will share with parties on their site. If third parties do share this information, Chrome strongly encourages them to be transparent to users about such sharing, and offer them controls.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Miscategorized sites
   </td>
   <td>Sites are miscategorized to the wrong topic, which may result in inaccurate ads targeting. 
   </td>
   <td>Sites are classified through a combination of a human-curated override list, containing the most popular sites, and an on-device ML model. Chrome continues to evaluate options for sites to contribute to Topics classification. Any utility improvements must be weighed against the privacy and abuse risks. For example, a few of the risks include:<ul>

<li>sites using self-labelling as a method to encode different (and potentially sensitive) meanings into topics;
<li>sites misrepresenting their topics for financial gain; 
<li>sites attacking topics in order to blunt its usefulness for others (e.g., spamming the user's topics with meaningless noise). </li>
</ul>

<p>
The public can inspect these components, with tooling available via a chrome://topics-internals or this <a href="https://colab.sandbox.google.com/drive/1hIVoz8bRCTpllYvads51MV7YS3zi3prn?usp=sharing">colab</a>. Through testing, we expect classification to improve over time, and we <a href="/docs/privacy-sandbox/feedback/#feedback-routes">welcome feedback</a> of examples of sites that may be miscategorized.

   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Access requirements
   </td>
   <td>Current Topics requirement for DOM entity on-page as a script or iframe in order for access may lead to undesirable behaviors by players in the ads ecosystem.
   </td>
   <td>We have merged a <a href="https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/topics/pull/81">change on the Github explainer</a>. We intend to support Topics in HTTP headers.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Topics taxonomy not granular enough
   </td>
   <td>Current topics classifications are too broad, and does not include more granular topics, such as regional topics.
   </td>
   <td>Improvements to the taxonomy are an ongoing effort, and we expect the taxonomy to evolve with ecosystem testing and input.
<p>
We are actively <a href="https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/topics/issues/3">seeking feedback</a> on the taxonomy that would be most useful for the ecosystem. In evaluating whether to expand the number of topics or include more granular topics, there are a few considerations including 1) potential privacy implications (e.g. more topics may introduce fingerprinting risk) and 2) ability to retrieve previously observed topics (e.g. with more topics, there may be less of a chance that an ad-tech has seen the chosen topic in the past). Expanding on #2, Google seeks to maximize callers’ ability to retrieve previously observed topics, within the existing filtering requirement, with the goal of achieving both utility and privacy.
   </td>

  <tr>
   <td>Topics limit
   </td>
   <td>Three topics per website is too little information for advertisers to serve ads to.
   </td>
   <td>Feedback from the ecosystem, especially testing results from our Origin Trials, will continue to influence the evolution of the API. It is worth noting that Topics is expected to supplement other signals like contextual to help find an appropriate advertisement for the visitor. So, there can be more information available to the advertiser beyond topics.
   </td>

<p>
User controls and safety
   </td>
   <td>Certain topics may be proxies for sensitive groups and users need more controls to prevent negative outcomes.
   </td>
   <td><em>Q3 Update:</em>
<p>
Topics represent a significant step forward for user control and transparency. Users will be able to opt out of topics, review the topics that have been assigned to them, remove topics, and understand which companies are interacting with their topics on a given page. In addition, users can also clear their Topics by deleting their browsing history, from which topics are derived. These controls are currently implemented on the Chrome browser at the device level.  We welcome continued discussion regarding more advanced user controls, such as those suggested by developers; however we need to make sure that  new additions are well calibrated to address the concerns raised and don’t result in making piecemeal changes.
   </td>

  <tr>
   <td>Impact on SEO
   </td>
   <td>Publishers adjusting their website's hostnames to better reflect Topics may negatively impact SEO.
   </td>
   <td>We would caution sites against changing their hostnames solely for the sake of Topics. It's true that a site may be able to influence its assigned topics in this way. But the benefits to publishers of doing so are unclear at best, and it would undermine the value of Topics for the entire ecosystem if sites try to "game" the classification model. Topic assignments are also not fixed; we expect the taxonomy to continue to evolve with testing and input. In connection with this testing, we <a href="/docs/privacy-sandbox/feedback/#feedback-routes">encourage feedback</a>, including any examples of sites that may be miscategorized.

We encourage the ecosystem to contribute to the active discussion <a href="https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/topics/issues/86">here</a>. While we are currently focused on other, higher priority improvements, we recognize that this could be an important future addition to the design.

  <tr>
   <td>Fraud & Abuse
   </td>
   <td>Allow for public review of parties that are legitimate users of Topics data, through the same kind of public posting and review that a first-party set would be subjected to.
   </td>
   <td>We appreciate the suggestion and agree that public accountability is an important tool for helping achieve the goals of the Privacy Sandbox. Topics API calls are inherently public, since anyone can visit a site and observe a domain's calls to the JavaScript API. Individuals and organizations can therefore view the relevant activity and assess which sites are using Topics and how. We believe that this is a better approach than making assessments of a site’s “legitimacy” part of the functionality of the Topics API itself. 
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Impact on first-party signals
   </td>
   <td>Topics signal may be highly valuable and as a result devalues other first-party interest-based signals.  
   </td>
   <td>We believe interest-based advertising is an important use case for the web, and Topics is designed to support that use case. As described above, other ecosystem stakeholders have expressed concerns that Topics may not be useful enough to provide value. In all cases, improvements to the taxonomy are an ongoing effort, and we expect the taxonomy to evolve with ecosystem testing and input.

However, an interest group owner can theoretically track every call to navigator.joininterestgroup(...). Tracking this call does not guarantee the exact size of an IG (as users can leave a group at any time), but it gives the owner an upper limit and an approximation of what the size could be.
