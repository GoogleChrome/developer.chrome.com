  Quarterly report for 2022 Q2 summarising the ecosystem feedback received on
  Privacy Sandbox proposals and Chrome's response.

As part of its commitments to the CMA, Google has agreed to publicly provide
quarterly reports on the stakeholder engagement process for its Privacy Sandbox
proposals (see paragraphs 12 and 17(c)(ii) of [the
Commitments](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/62052c6a8fa8f510a204374a/100222_Appendix_1A_Google_s_final_commitments.pdf)).
These Privacy Sandbox feedback summary reports are generated by aggregating
feedback received by Chrome from the various sources as listed in the [feedback
overview](/docs/privacy-sandbox/feedback/), including but not limited to: GitHub
Issues, the feedback form made available on
[privacysandbox.com](https://privacysandbox.com/), meetings with industry
stakeholders, and web standards forums. Chrome welcomes the feedback received
from the ecosystem and is actively exploring ways to integrate learnings into
design decisions.

Feedback themes are ranked by prevalence per API. This is done by taking an
aggregation of the amount of feedback that the Chrome team has received around a
given theme and organizing in descending order of quantity. The common feedback
themes were identified by reviewing topics of discussion from public meetings
(W3C, PatCG, IETF), direct feedback, GitHub, and commonly asked questions
surfacing through Google’s internal teams and public forms.

More specifically, meeting minutes for web standard bodies meetings were
reviewed and, for direct feedback, Google’s records of 1:1 stakeholder meetings,
emails received by individual engineers, the API mailing list, and the public
feedback form were considered. Google then coordinated between the teams
involved in these various outreach activities to determine the relative
prevalence of the themes emerging in relation to each API.

The explanations of Chrome’s responses to feedback were developed from published
FAQs, actual responses made to issues raised by stakeholders, and determining a
position specifically for the purposes of this public reporting exercise.
Reflecting the current focus of development and testing, questions and feedback
were received in particular with respect to Topics, Fledge and Attribution
Reporting APIs. 

Feedback received after the end of the current reporting period may not yet have
a considered Chrome response.

These take into consideration development time for both Chrome and web developers, as well as feedback we’ve received from the broader ecosystem on time needed to test and adopt the new technologies. Each technology goes through multiple steps from testing to release (launch) and the timing of each step is informed by what we learn and uncover in the prior step. While we don’t have committed releases at this time, as we do, we’ll be sure to update our public timeline on <a href="http://www.privacysandbox.com">privacysandbox.com</a>.

Google has committed to the CMA not to design or implement the Privacy Sandbox proposals in a way that distorts competition by self-preferencing Google’s own business, and to take into account impact on competition in digital advertising and on publishers and advertisers, as well as impacts on privacy outcomes and user experience. We continue to work closely with the CMA to ensure that our work complies with these commitments. 
<p>
As testing of the Privacy Sandbox progresses, one of the key questions we will assess is how the new technologies perform for different types of stakeholders. <a href="/docs/privacy-sandbox/feedback/">Feedback</a> is critical in this respect, especially specific and actionable feedback that can help us further improve the technical designs.

   </td>
   <td>The usefulness of the API will be explored through testing. Chrome expects the taxonomy and other parameters to evolve based on testing results. The evolution of the taxonomy or parameters may not require backwards incompatible changes. Further, Chrome expects feedback to continue influencing the Topics API evolution after third-party cookie deprecation.

These decisions were made with privacy in mind - to limit access to information to those that otherwise wouldn't have had access to such information and introduce plausible deniability for users, respectively.  We recognize that those decisions have drawbacks, such as the attack vector outlined <a href="https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/topics/issues/75">here</a>. However, our assessment is that the privacy benefits outweigh the potential risks. We welcome public discussion on this decision.

Users will be able to opt out of topics, review the topics that have been assigned to them, remove topics, and understand which companies are interacting with their topics on a given page. In addition, users can also impact their Topics by deleting their browsing history. We welcome continued discussion regarding more advanced user controls, such as those suggested by developers; however we need to make sure that for the concerns raised in this bug, it actually removes the risks (for example, removing just the Topic ‘foreign language study’ but not the websites that generated the Topic from Browsing History does not fully protect the user).

Of course, publishers and third parties that receive Topics could decide for themselves what information they will share with parties on their site. If they do this type of sharing, Chrome strongly encourages them to be transparent to their users about such sharing, and offer them controls.

A summary of the meeting is that the current design for <a href="https://github.com/WICG/turtledove/blob/main/Fenced_Frames_Ads_Reporting.md">Fenced Frames Ad Reporting</a> makes it possible to associate an id generated inside the Fenced Frame with contextual information.

   <td>FLEDGE is designed to avoid information leakage that isn't relevant when the publisher already knows what SDAs its visitors are in and targeting is same-site. If it is important to support buying on SDAs within all of the protections built into FLEDGE, then one solution may be for a seller to pass SDA labels into the on-device auction, and a buy-side ad tech to create their own Interest Group whose bidding logic says "I want to buy Audience X."
