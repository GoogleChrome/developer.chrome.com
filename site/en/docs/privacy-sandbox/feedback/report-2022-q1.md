  Quarterly report for 2022 Q1 summarising the ecosystem feedback received on
  Privacy Sandbox proposals and Chrome's response.

As part of its commitments to the Competition and Markets Authority, Google has
agreed to publicly provide quarterly reports on the stakeholder engagement
process for its Privacy Sandbox proposals (see paragraphs 12 and 17(c)(ii) of
[the
Commitments](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/62052c6a8fa8f510a204374a/100222_Appendix_1A_Google_s_final_commitments.pdf)).
These Privacy Sandbox feedback summary reports are generated by aggregating
feedback received by Chrome from the various sources as listed in the [feedback
overview](/docs/privacy-sandbox/feedback/), including but not limited to: GitHub
Issues, the feedback form made available on
[privacysandbox.com](https://privacysandbox.com/), meetings with industry
stakeholders, and web standards forums. Chrome welcomes the feedback received
from the ecosystem and is actively exploring ways to integrate learnings into
design decisions.

Feedback themes are ranked by prevalence per API. This is done by taking an
aggregation of the amount of feedback that the Chrome team has received around a
given theme and organizing in descending order of quantity. The common feedback
themes were identified by reviewing topics of discussion from public meetings
(W3C, PatCG, IETF), direct feedback, GitHub, and commonly asked questions
surfacing through Google’s internal teams and public forms.

More specifically, meeting minutes for web standard bodies meetings were
reviewed and, for direct feedback, Google’s records of 1:1 stakeholder meetings,
emails received by individual engineers, the API mailing list, and the public
feedback form were considered. Google then coordinated between the teams
involved in these various outreach activities to determine the relative
prevalence of the themes emerging in relation to each API.

The explanations of Chrome’s responses to feedback were developed from published
FAQs, actual responses made to issues raised by stakeholders, and determining a
position specifically for the purposes of this public reporting exercise.
Reflecting the current focus of development and testing, questions and feedback
were received in particular with respect to Topics, Fledge and Attribution
Reporting APIs and technologies. 

Feedback received recently may not yet have a considered Chrome response.

## Common themes from all feedback sources

A common theme across our discussions and feedback channels is questions about the timing, traffic levels and availability of testing. In particular, testers have consistently wanted confirmation of when APIs will be available for testing and whether testing will be available globally.

To address this feedback, Chrome has communicated broadly, and Chrome will post an FAQ confirming the same, that testing will be available globally. Furthermore, Chrome will continue to update public timelines in consultation with the CMA regularly.

Of course, publishers and third parties that receive Topics could decide for themselves what information they will share with parties on their site. If they do this type of sharing, Chrome strongly encourages them to be transparent to their users about such sharing, and offer them controls.

   <td>Concerns if there will be enough traffic for testing
   </td>
   <td>Chrome is starting the origin trial at very low traffic to ensure that there aren’t any serious bugs or issues with user controls. Early testers play an important part in confirming that the APIs are working as intended from a technical standpoint, which helps to ramp up to a larger traffic faster. Once there is confidence that the APIs are functioning as expected, Chrome will increase the origin trial to support utility testing.

However, it’s possible that methods like aggregating over longer periods of time would solve this problem;  it’s also unclear if the conclusions based on very small data slices (like one or two purchases) are meaningful to advertisers. During the origin trial, Chrome encourages testers to take advantage of the ability to experiment with a wide range of privacy and noise parameters so they can provide more specific feedback on this issue.

   <td>Concern that testing with CHIPS may not be possible alongside other Privacy Sandbox proposals, like First Party Sets
   </td>
   <td>Chrome is actively exploring how to facilitate testing environments that would allow for such tests to occur. Chrome has also published instructions for local testing for <a href="/blog/first-party-sets-sameparty/#how-do-you-get-involved">FPS</a>, and <a href="/docs/privacy-sandbox/chips/#try-it-out">CHIPS</a>; which can be used in the interim.

   <td>Concern that because the browser renders part of the federated identity flow, it is hard to capture all of the nuances that IDPs would like to present to their users
   </td>
   <td>Chrome recognizes the trade-off and will continue to work with the ecosystem to both cover as much ground as possible and to make it as expressive as possible. Some ideas Chrome is exploring include branding customizations (e.g. logos, colors) and string customization (e.g. “access this article” as opposed to “login with'').

   <td>Concern whether there is going to be a control (e.g. enterprise policies and/or user settings) that would allow enterprises to keep their deployment of federated identity without any changes. There are a lot of on-premise deployments of federated identity that are exceptionally hard to re-deploy / change, so there is a lot of resistance towards new browser API that require IDPs to redeploy.
   </td>
   <td>Chrome is exploring controls for enterprise admins and users that it believes will address these concerns. Chrome welcomes feedback from enterprises on specific use cases that they would like to see accounted for.

   <td>Concerns around 2 per page being too restrictive, especially for scenarios where one may be embedded on the same page multiple times or have a second issuer domain within their organization. One would likely hit the limit themselves without considering other market participants.  
   </td>
   <td>Chrome is open to expanding the redemption limit per page slightly if it would increase adoption, but need to keep it relatively low in order to introduce excessive entropy.  Further, caching a redemption record may reduce the need for one issuer to redeem multiple tokens for a single user in a short period of time.
