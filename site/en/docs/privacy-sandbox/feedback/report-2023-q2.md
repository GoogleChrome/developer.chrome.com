<!-- noop -->
As part of its commitments to the CMA, Google has agreed to publicly provide
quarterly reports on the stakeholder engagement process for its Privacy Sandbox
proposals (refer to paragraphs 12 and 17(c)(ii) of [the
Commitments](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/62052c6a8fa8f510a204374a/100222_Appendix_1A_Google_s_final_commitments.pdf)).
These Privacy Sandbox feedback summary reports are generated by aggregating
feedback received by Chrome from the various sources as listed in the [feedback
overview](/docs/privacy-sandbox/feedback/), including but not limited to: GitHub
Issues, the feedback form made available on
[privacysandbox.com](https://privacysandbox.com/), meetings with industry
stakeholders, and web standards forums. Chrome welcomes the feedback received
from the ecosystem and is actively exploring ways to integrate learnings into
design decisions.

Feedback themes are ranked by prevalence per API. This is done by taking an
aggregation of the amount of feedback that the Chrome team has received around a
given theme and organizing in descending order of quantity. The common feedback
themes were identified by reviewing topics of discussion from public meetings
(W3C, PatCG, IETF), direct feedback, GitHub, and commonly asked questions
surfacing through Google's internal teams and public forms.

More specifically, meeting minutes for web standard bodies meetings were
reviewed and, for direct feedback, Google's records of 1:1 stakeholder meetings,
emails received by individual engineers, the API mailing list, and the public
feedback form were considered. Google then coordinated between the teams
involved in these various outreach activities to determine the relative
prevalence of the themes emerging in relation to each API.

The explanations of Chrome's responses to feedback were developed from published
FAQs, actual responses made to issues raised by stakeholders, and determining a
position specifically for the purposes of this public reporting exercise.
Reflecting the current focus of development and testing, questions and feedback
were received in particular with respect to Topics, Protected Audience, and Attribution
Reporting APIs. 

Feedback received after the end of the current reporting period may not yet have
a considered Chrome response.

We are aware, however, that this is a key area of interest for the ecosystem. For each API, we have published extensive technical documentation, which should provide the basis to make necessary legal assessments, and we are working on making available additional materials in support of companies' efforts to comply with regulatory requirements. </td>

The requirements vary depending on the market, so participants should be sure to check the website for the specific market they are interested in. In general, however, participants will need to provide basic information about their business, such as the name of the business, the address, and the contact information for the business owner or manager. Participants may also be asked to provide financial information, such as the business's annual revenue. Once the application is complete, D&B will review it and issue a D-U-N-S Number if the application is approved.</td>

      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Research evaluating the Topics API on privacy preservation</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">We are actively involved with the research community, presenting our research on the privacy properties of the Topics API in papers, reports, and workshop presentations. We are happy to see more external members of the research community engaging with this area.<br>
<br>
The Topics API protects users against general tracking on the web by making it too difficult to track users at scale. These papers show that we're successfully doing so with the Topics API. It's more private than third-party cookies and protects users while supporting the sites they enjoy visiting.</td>

    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Topics taxonomy not granular enough</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Broad topics taxonomy does not include more granular topics, including region specific.</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">In response to previous feedback from the ecosystem, we published a <a href="/blog/topics-enhancements/">blog post</a> on June 15 detailing a new updated taxonomy that incorporates numerous improvements following feedback from the ecosystem. As part of our work on the revised taxonomy, we've engaged with several companies across the ecosystem, such as Raptive (formerly CafeMedia) and Criteo. The updated taxonomy removes categories we've heard are less useful, in favor of categories that better match advertiser interests, while maintaining our commitment to exclude potentially sensitive topics.<br>
<br>
We encourage the ecosystem to review the latest taxonomy and provide feedback on the changes.</td>
    </tr>

      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Taxonomy and classifier update process</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">More information on the Topics taxonomy and classifier release cadence and how companies can prepare for such updates.</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">As shared in the recent <a href="/blog/topics-enhancements/">blog post</a>, we expect the taxonomy to evolve over time, and for governance of the taxonomy to eventually transition to an external party representing stakeholders from across the industry. We also shared the ramp-up plan in the <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/topics-api-announce/c/iNYk69wKnJs">topics-announce</a> group.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Impact on first-party signals</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">The increase in number of Topics in the recent Taxonomy update may be highly valuable and as a result devalues other first-party interest-based signals.</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">In the Q1 2023 report, the CMA commented that "We understand that Google has been discussing its proposed new taxonomy with several market participants across the ad tech supply chain. While a few large publishers have said that greater utility of topics would increase competitive pressure on their first-party data based solutions, our preliminary view is that greater utility is better for competition overall – in particular for the ability of smaller publishers to continue monetising their inventory after the deprecation of third-party cookies". Our view is aligned with this comment made by the CMA. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Usefulness for different types of stakeholders</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Ad techs that act as SSPs and DSPs may have significant advantages over other ecosystem players.</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Our response is unchanged from previous quarters: <br>
<br>
"Google has committed to the CMA to design and implement the Privacy Sandbox proposals in a way that does not distort competition by self-preferencing Google's own business, and to take into account impact on competition in digital advertising and on publishers and advertisers, regardless of their size. We continue to work closely with the CMA to ensure that our work complies with these commitments. As testing of the Privacy Sandbox progresses, one of the key questions we will assess is how the new technologies perform for different types of stakeholders. Feedback is critical in this respect, especially specific and actionable feedback that can help us further improve the technical designs. We have worked with the CMA to develop our approach to quantitative testing, and are supportive of the CMA publishing a note on experiment design to provide more information to market participants and an opportunity to comment on the proposed approaches."</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Descendant Topics</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">With Topic selection criteria being frequency of browser visits, will segment fragmentation lead to descendant topics never rising to the top?</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Chrome is currently evaluating other ranking methodologies, and exploring other signals that may improve ranking. We will communicate our revised plans to the ecosystem in due course.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Sensitivity</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">The Topics API's goal should be to ensure user information obtained or derived from the Topics API should be less personally sensitive than what could be derived using today's tracking methods.</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">We believe the Topics API is significantly more private than current technologies, significantly limits re-identification of users, and is designed to exclude sensitive topics. We acknowledge that topics can be correlated or combined with first-party data to create sensitive categories, but we believe the Topics API is a step forward to user privacy and we are committed to continue improving the API.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Taxonomy Structure</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Add ID, Versioning, and other metadata structure to the Topics Taxonomy</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Currently, in the API response, we are including the taxonomy ID. As we move towards long-term governance, it makes sense to review the Topics object and include additional metadata on versioning if required.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Publisher control</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Publishers should have a say in what Topics their sites should be classified as.</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Misclassification of sites may make the Topics signal slightly less useful as a signal overall, but the specific sites that are misclassified are no more and no less harmed by this than any other sites. This is because a site's contextual information will always be available for auctions on their site, which would provide comparable information to the correct topic, even in the case of misclassification. We welcome <a href="https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/topics/issues/2">feedback on this subject here</a>.<br>
<br>
Allowing publishers to control their classification has risks. Sites may incorrectly classify their sites intentionally, reducing utility for all, or encode sensitive meanings in less common topics, harming user privacy.</td>

Given Privacy Sandbox security requirements and the significant challenges presented by on-premise deployments, we believe that continuing to expand and improve cloud-based deployments (e.g. supporting GCP in addition to AWS) is the most beneficial for the ecosystem. However, we <a href="http://github.com/privacysandbox/fledge-docs/issues/34">welcome additional feedback</a> on why such a requirement is necessary.</td>

      <td style="vertical-align: top;">While our design fully supports <code>runAdAuction</code> to be callable from the top page, we believe it would be more harmful for publishers to restrict it to only be callable from the top domain.<br>
<br>
We have specifically heard from the ecosystem that the Privacy Sandbox needs to minimize the burden on publishers and advertisers. That feedback aligns with the general principle of web development that site owners can use third-party tools in running their sites. The Privacy Sandbox goal has been to encourage a healthy ecosystem without needing to prescribe how publishers and ad techs work.<br>
<br>
By allowing the publisher to choose how and who calls <code>runAdAuction</code> on their site, we believe we offer flexibility to publishers to find the best path for their requirements.</td>

<br>
We have published guidance on how the APIs work on our GitHub repository and are open to exploring solutions with the industry.<br>

Buyers can return either format via a renderURL. The VAST specification was <a href="https://iabtechlab.com/blog/introducing-vast-support-for-google-chrome-cookieless-attribution-reporting/">recently updated</a> to support the Attribution Reporting API. Sites serving video ads will need to prepare for the way ads are delivered via the Protected Audience API. This means making sure placement tags can pass the URL from a Protected Audience iframe to a video player.

      <td style="vertical-align: top;">We have updated the spec to be more clear about what user data is able to be conveyed using Private State Tokens. By design, up to six public keys can be used at a time, which may represent a "state" for a particular user. These sets of keys can only be updated every 60 days (except in rare cases where an emergency key rotation is necessary), which slows down the potential to join additional user data over time. With any new web API, there is a balance of utility provided and net new user information that it provides. We estimate that PSTs strike the appropriate balance in protecting user privacy while enabling key anti-fraud use cases impacted by third-party cookie deprecation. </td>

The key commitment format in PrivacyPass isn't particularly suited for a version where the keysets are intended to allow for an implicit "public metadata" value. If a variant of PrivacyPass ends up getting standardized with public metadata (either as a POPRF, partial RSA blinding, or keysets) we might move to a future version of PST to support that.</td>
