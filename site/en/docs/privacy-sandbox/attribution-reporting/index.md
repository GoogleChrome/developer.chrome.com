## Get started

Head over to [Attribution Reporting in five minutes](/docs/privacy-sandbox/attribution-reporting-in-short) for a quick overview of the Attribution Reporting API.

## Learn more

- [Introduction to Attribution Reporting (Conversion Measurement)](/docs/privacy-sandbox/attribution-reporting-introduction) gives you an in-depth
  introduction to the API's use cases, features, and privacy model.
- Event-level reports:

  - [Event-level reports in the Attribution Reporting API](/docs/privacy-sandbox/attribution-reporting-event-introduction/)
  - [Using event-level reports in the Attribution Reporting API](/docs/privacy-sandbox/attribution-reporting-event-guide/)

- [FAQ: Impact of user-initiated data clearing on attribution reports](/docs/privacy-sandbox/attribution-reporting-data-clearing/)
- [Migration guide (Chrome 92): Conversion Measurement API to Attribution Reporting API](/docs/privacy-sandbox/attribution-reporting-migration/)

## See the timeline

- Head over to the [Privacy Sandbox timeline](https://privacysandbox.com/timeline) for an overview of the various stages of development for this API.
- The [Attribution Reporting status overview](/docs/privacy-sandbox/attribution-reporting-introduction/#status) is a detailed view of the status of different features within the API.

## Try out the API

Try out the [demo](https://goo.gle/demo-event-level-conversion-measurement-api) to see the API in
action in your browser. This demo features event-level reports for clicks, which is a subset of the
features the API aims to support.

_For developers:_

- See [how to build a prototype and/or experiment
  locally](/docs/privacy-sandbox/attribution-reporting-introduction/#experiment-locally-or-with-a-demo).
- Ask technical questions about your implementation on the [Privacy Sandbox Developer Support
  repo](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/privacy-sandbox-dev-support) or on the [Attribution
  Reporting mailing list for
  developers](https://groups.google.com/u/0/a/chromium.org/g/attribution-reporting-api-dev).
- Register for an [origin trial](/origintrials/#/view_trial/3411476717733150721) to experiment with end
  users on a deployed site.

## Join the discussion

{% Aside %}  
**Your participation is needed!** Ecosystem input is vital to ensure that your conversion
measurement, optimization, and other use cases are discussed in the open. {% endAside %}

### Discuss the Attribution Reporting API

This API is a proposal; it lives [here](https://github.com/WICG/conversion-measurement-api/).
Proposals like this one are documented and discussed publicly, and often live on a
platform called _GitHub_. On GitHub, discussions are called _issues_.

- Join the conversation in [existing
  issues](https://github.com/WICG/conversion-measurement-api/issues).
- [Open a new issue](https://github.com/WICG/conversion-measurement-api/issues/new) to ask questions,
  propose features, or discuss use cases. If you're unsure how to formulate your issue, see [this issue](https://github.com/WICG/conversion-measurement-api/issues/147) as an example.
- Discussions also take place in a [biweekly
  meeting](https://github.com/WICG/conversion-measurement-api/issues/80) (every second week).
  Everyone is welcome to join these discussions‚è§only make sure to [join the
  WICG](https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/). You can discuss use cases or API design questions others have submitted, submit an agenda item yourself, or just listen in!

### Discuss related topics
