It's possible for two distinct entities to generate and receive attribution reports for a given set of source events, trigger events, or both. To register multiple reporters, you can rely on redirects, or choose other options, as discussed here.

## Register several triggers using redirects

The following example illustrates the use of redirects to register multiple triggers. In this example, `reporter-1.example` and `reporter-2.example` are two distinct entities looking to generate and receive attribution reports.

At source registration time, the following steps take place:

1. `reporter-1.example` receives a request from the browser.
1. `reporter-1.example` sends a response that contains the `Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source` header. It could be a regular response but, in this example, it's a redirect to `reporter-2.example` because `reporter-2.example` is another reporter looking to generate and receive attribution reports.
Note: If `reporter-1` intends to rely completely on `reporter-2` as a measurement service, and does not intend to do any measurement themselves, `reporter-1.example` can omit the `Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source` header.
1. The browser receives this response. It reads `Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source` and therefore stores a source event, using `reporter-1.example` as the reporting origin. 
1. Because this request is a redirect, the browser also makes a new request to `reporter-2.example`.
1. `reporter-2.example` responds with a regular response that contains the `Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source` header. The destination value in this header must be identical to the destination value of the `Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source` header set by `reporter-1.example`. Otherwise, the source will not be registered.
1. The browser receives this response; it reads `Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source` and stores a source event, using `reporter-2.example` as the reporting origin.

## Rely on `attributionsrc` for source registration 

If multiple reporter origins want to register a source on a navigation event, but can't appear in a redirect chain for any reason, you can list multiple sites as attribution sources in `attributionsrc` as an alternative solution. 

At trigger registration time, redirect requests in the same way as for source registration. Source events and trigger events that have been generated by the same origins will be matched.

## Register multiple triggers without redirects

If you need to register multiple attribution triggers without using redirects, you can do so by adding multiple pixel elements on the conversion side (one per trigger).
