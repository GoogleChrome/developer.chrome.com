It is possible for two distinct entities to generate and receive attribution reports for a given set of source and/or trigger events.
To achieve this outcome, you can rely on redirects or on other approaches.

## Registering multiple triggers without redirects

It's possible to register multiple attribution triggers without using redirects, by adding multiple pixel elements on the conversion side (one per trigger).

## Registering several triggers using redirects

It's also possible to register several triggers using redirects. In this example, `reporter-1.example` and `reporter-2.example` are two distinct entities looking to generate and receive attribution reports. Here's the flow:

At source registration time:

1. `reporter-1.example` receives a request from the browser.
1. `reporter-1.example` sends a response that contains the Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source header. It could be a regular response but, in this example, it's a redirect to `reporter-2.example` because `reporter-2.example` is another reporter looking to generate and receive attribution reports.
Note: If `reporter-1` intends to rely completely on `reporter-2` as a measurement service, and does not intend to do any measurement themselves, `reporter-1.example` can omit the `Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source` header.
1. The browser receives this response. It reads `Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source` and hence stores a source event, using `reporter-1.example` as the reporting origin. 
1. Because this request is a redirect, the browser also makes a new request to `reporter-2.example`.
1. `reporter-2.example` responds with a regular response that contains the `Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source` header. The destination value in this header must be identical to the destination value of the `Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source` header set by `reporter-1.example`. Otherwise, the source will not be registered.
1. The browser receives this response; it reads `Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source` and stores a source event, using `reporter-2.example` as the reporting origin.

## Rely on `attributionsrc` instead of redirects

If multiple reporters origins want to register a source on a navigation, but cannot appear in a redirect chain for some reason, you can alternatively list multiple sites as attribution sources in `attributionsrc`.

At trigger registration time:

1. Requests can be redirected in the same way as for source registration. 
1. Source events and trigger events that have been generated by the same origins will be matchedâ€”respectively, `reporter-1.example` and `reporter-2.example`.
