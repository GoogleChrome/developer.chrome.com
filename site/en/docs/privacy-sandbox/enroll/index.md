Developer Enrollment provides a mechanism to verify the entities that call these APIs and gather developer-specific data needed to properly configure and use the Privacy Sandbox APIs. To access the Privacy Sandbox relevance and measurement APIs on [Chrome](/docs/privacy-sandbox/) and [Android](https://developer.android.com/design-for-safety/privacy-sandbox), developers must enroll with the Privacy Sandbox. This includes Attribution Reporting, Protected Audience, Topics, Fenced Frames, and Shared Storage.
