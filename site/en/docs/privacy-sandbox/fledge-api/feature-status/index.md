As we move [FLEDGE](/docs/privacy-sandbox/fledge/) closer to general availability and approach third-party cookie deprecation in Chrome, you may be wondering about the availability of FLEDGE services and features. In this update, we provide a list of the scoped FLEDGE features and when they’ll be supported.

   <p>This feature is intended to make the transition to FLEDGE reporting from third-party cookie reporting easier. Thus, this reporting will not be supported after adtechs have had time to update their reporting mechanisms.

## Event-level auction win reporting

We initially indicated that the event-level auction win reporting would be a temporary solution, and [aggregation](/docs/privacy-sandbox/private-aggregation/) will be used. After listening to feedback and examining the relative complexity of aggregation-based solutions, particularly for billing, we have decided to not remove support for [event-level auction win results reporting](https://github.com/WICG/turtledove/blob/main/FLEDGE.md#5-event-level-reporting-for-now) with `reportResult()` and `reportWin()` functions having the ability to call [`sendReportTo()`](https://github.com/WICG/turtledove/blob/main/Proposed_First_FLEDGE_OT_Details.md#reporting) until sometime after third-party cookie deprecation. 

Event-level auction win reporting will be supported until at least 2026, and we will provide advanced notice before the API transitions to any alternative solutions. 

Auction loss reporting will continue to be supported through the [Private Aggregation API](https://github.com/WICG/turtledove/blob/main/FLEDGE_extended_PA_reporting.md).

## Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) usage for Key/Value service

The [FLEDGE Key/Value service](/blog/open-sourcing-fledge-key-value-service/) allows the auction to retrieve real-time signals when the bid is generated by the buyer and the ad is scored by the seller. The Key/Value service will eventually be required to run in a [trusted execution environment (TEE)](https://github.com/privacysandbox/fledge-docs/blob/main/trusted_services_overview.md#trusted-execution-environment) to ensure that the user’s data is kept private.

Running the Key/Value service in a TEE will not be required until sometime after third-party cookie deprecation. We will provide at least 12 months notice before TEE usage is mandatory. Until then, you can continue to use [your own server](https://github.com/WICG/turtledove/blob/main/FLEDGE.md#3-buyers-provide-ads-and-bidding-functions-byos-for-now) for real-time key/value signals. Note that running the Key/Value service in a TEE with [user-defined functions](https://github.com/privacysandbox/fledge-docs/blob/main/key_value_service_trust_model.md#support-for-user-defined-functions-udfs) (UDFs) will be available for testing by the end of Q1 2023 with on-device FLEDGE. 

## Fenced frames

[Fenced frames](/docs/privacy-sandbox/fenced-frame/) are a new HTML element that limits communication between the content and the embedder, and is used for rendering content based on cross-site data. FLEDGE will render content into a fenced frame.

After working closely with various stakeholders and examining the significant effort to accommodate this change, Chrome will not mandate fenced frames until at least 2026 to maintain ecosystem inclusivity,and Chrome will provide significant advanced notice. Until then, if fenced frames are not used, you will need to use an iframe to render the [opaque URN](https://github.com/WICG/fenced-frame/blob/master/explainer/opaque_src.md). Also, it should be noted that sellers could still require the use of Fenced Frames.

{% Aside %}
The temporary `navigator.deprecatedURNToURL()` will be removed by third-party cookie deprecation.

## Improved FLEDGE + Attribution Reporting integration

Recently, challenges have been [pointed out](https://github.com/WICG/turtledove/issues/281) around the integration of the [Attribution Reporting API](/docs/privacy-sandbox/attribution-reporting/) and FLEDGE, especially in the situation where fenced frames are involved. 

For event-level attribution reporting with FLEDGE, we have a proposed set of initial improvements to make this integration easier which you can learn more about in the [explainer](https://github.com/WICG/turtledove/blob/main/Fenced_Frames_Ads_Reporting.md#support-for-attribution-reporting). The integration will be available in both Fenced Frames and iFrames. 

For those who need [aggregate attribution reporting with FLEDGE](https://github.com/WICG/turtledove/issues/289), we are working on more flexible solutions to capture more bidding signals with aggregate reporting, and we will publish a proposal once it is ready. 

## K-anonymity

We will soon publish an explainer with more details on how [k-anonymity](https://github.com/WICG/turtledove/blob/main/FLEDGE_k_anonymity_server.md) will be enforced using the FLEDGE framework.

For rendering a creative, we will require _a crowd of 50 users per creative within the past 7 days_ to pass the k-anonymity threshold before the ad can be served. The creative is available to be served as soon as it hits the 50 ads threshold and does not need to wait for 7 days. 

K-anonymity requirements will be available for testing and will be enforced later in 2023. We encourage feedback from ad tech on this parameter.

## Bidding and Auction Services

We have heard some concerns about [FLEDGE latency](https://github.com/WICG/turtledove/issues/385) and are actively working on improving on-device latency. Both Chrome and Android plan to provide [Bidding and Auction Services](https://github.com/privacysandbox/fledge-docs/blob/main/bidding_auction_services_api.md) as an additional way to run bidding and scoring logic besides on-device auctions. Bidding and Auction services is a [FLEDGE service](/blog/fledge-service-overview/) solution for running auctions off-device, which we believe will allow for even faster performance.

We will continue to support on-device auctions, and the use of the Bidding and Auction Services is not required unless it fits your use cases.

More details can be found in the [blog post](/blog/bidding-and-auction-services-availability/).
