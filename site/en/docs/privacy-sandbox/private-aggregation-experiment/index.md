Read the [Private Aggregation API overview](/docs/privacy-sandbox/private-aggregation/)
and [Shared Storage overview](/docs/privacy-sandbox/shared-storage/).
See the use cases and review
[fundamental concepts](/docs/privacy-sandbox/private-aggregation-fundamentals/)
for the Private Aggregation API.

## Try the API

1. Try the [demo](http://goo.gle/shared-storage-demo). The code is available on
   [GitHub](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/shared-storage-demo).
2. Experiment with the API. The API is available in the [Privacy Sandbox unified origin trial](/docs/privacy-sandbox/unified-origin-trial/) on Chrome Canary, Dev, and Beta M107 or later.
   * Learn how you can register for a [third-party origin trial](/docs/web-platform/third-party-origin-trials/).
3. Generate summary reports with the [Aggregation Service](/docs/privacy-sandbox/aggregation-service).
   *  Set up
      [local testing](https://github.com/privacysandbox/aggregation-service/blob/main/README.md).
      The Aggregation Service for the Private Aggregation API is not yet
      available to test in a production environment.
