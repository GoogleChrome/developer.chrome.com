Read the [Private Aggregation API overview](/docs/privacy-sandbox/private-aggregation/) and [Shared Storage overview](/docs/privacy-sandbox/shared-storage/). See the use cases and review [fundamental concepts](/docs/privacy-sandbox/private-aggregation-fundamentals/) for the Private Aggregation API.

## Try the API

1. Try the [demo](http://goo.gle/shared-storage-demo). The code is available on
   [GitHub](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/shared-storage-demo).
2. Experiment with the API. The API is available in the [Privacy Sandbox unified origin trial](/docs/privacy-sandbox/unified-origin-trial/) on Chrome Canary and Dev M107 or later.
   * Learn how you can register for a [third-party origin trial](/docs/web-platform/third-party-origin-trials/).
3. Generate summary reports with the [Aggregation Service](/docs/privacy-sandbox/aggregation-service).
   *  Set up
      [local testing](https://github.com/privacysandbox/aggregation-service/blob/main/README.md)
      or [test in production with Amazon Web Services](https://github.com/google/trusted-execution-aggregation-service/#test-on-aws-with-support-for-encrypted-reports) (AWS) :
        *  Create or have an [AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) available.
        *  [Register](/origintrials/#/view_trial/771241436187197441) for the
	      Privacy Sandbox Relevance and Measurement origin trial (OT).
        *  Complete the Aggregation Service
	      [onboarding form](https://forms.gle/EHoecersGKhpcLPNA). After you've
		submitted this form, we'll send a verification email and instructions.
