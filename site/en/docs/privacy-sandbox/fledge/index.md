## What is FLEDGE? {: #what}

FLEDGE is a [Privacy Sandbox](/docs/privacy-sandbox/overview) proposal to serve
[remarketing](/docs/privacy-sandbox/glossary/#remarketing) and custom audience
use cases, designed so third parties cannot track user browsing behavior across sites.

The API enables on-device auctions by the browser, to choose relevant ads from
websites the user has previously visited.

FLEDGE is the first experiment to be implemented in Chromium within the
[TURTLEDOVE](https://github.com/WICG/turtledove) family of proposals. The
[Privacy Sandbox timeline](https://privacysandbox.com/timeline) provides implementation timing
information for FLEDGE and other Privacy Sandbox proposals.

### FLEDGE in one minute {: #overview}

For a more in-depth overview of FLEDGE, read the
[FLEDGE API developer guide](/docs/privacy-sandbox/fledge-api/).

</figure>

FLEDGE uses [interest groups](#interest-group-detail) to enable sites to
display ads that are relevant to their users.

For example, when a user visits a website that wants to advertise its products,
an interest group [owner](#interest-group-detail) (such as a
[demand side platform or DSP](/docs/privacy-sandbox/glossary/#dsp) working for the site) can ask the user's
browser to add membership for the interest group. The group owner (in this example, the DSP) does
this by calling the JavaScript function `navigator.joinAdInterestGroup()`. If the call is
successful, the browser records:

* The **name** of the interest group: for example, 'custom-bikes'.
* The **owner** of the interest group: for example, 'https://dsp.example'.
* Interest group **configuration information** to enable the browser to access
  bidding code, ad code, and realtime data, if the group's owner is invited to
  bid in an online ad auction. This information can be updated later by the
  interest group owner.

{% Aside %}

There are other use cases for interest groups: see the [examples of owners and types](#interest-group-types).

{% endAside %}

Later, when the user visits a site that sells ad space, the ad space seller
(most likely the site's 
[SSP](/docs/privacy-sandbox/glossary/#ssp), or the site itself) can use
FLEDGE to run an ad auction to select the most appropriate ads to display to the user. The seller
calls the `navigator.runAdAuction() `function, which provides a list of interest group owners who are invited to bid.

Bidding code is only run for interest groups that the browser is a member of,
and whose owners have been invited to bid.

Bidding code is retrieved from the URL provided in the configuration
information for the interest group. This code is passed data about the interest
group and information from the seller, along with contextual data about the
page and from the browser. 

Each bidder is also known as a buyer.

When the browser calls the function to run the ad auction, each buyer's code generates
a bid with the help of real-time data provided by their
[FLEDGE Key/Value service](#key-value-service-detail). Then, the seller receives these
bids as well as seller-owned real-time data, and scores each bid. The bid with the
highest score wins the auction.

The winning ad is displayed in a [fenced frame](/docs/privacy-sandbox/fenced-frame).
The ad creative's URL is specified in the bid, and the origin must match one in
the list provided by the interest group's configuration.

The seller can report the auction outcome (`reportResult()`), and buyers can
report their wins (`reportWin()`).

Learn how to [generate reports of the FLEDGE auction results](/docs/privacy-sandbox/fledge-api/reports/).

## Why do we need FLEDGE? {: #why}

Understanding user interests can enable more relevant ads than simply choosing
ads based on site content (contextual targeting) or by using information that
the user provided to the site on which the ad appears (first-party data targeting).

Traditionally, ad platforms have learned about user interests by tracking their
behavior across sites. Browsers need a way to enable ad platforms to select
relevant ads, so content publishers can get ad revenue, without cross-site
tracking.

The FLEDGE experiment aims to move the web platform closer to a state where the
user's browser, on their device—not the advertiser or adtech platforms—holds
information about what that person is interested in.

{% Aside 'warning' %}

Not all features described here have been implemented (in part or in full) in
the version of the FLEDGE API currently being tested in Chrome. The
[FLEDGE API developer guide](/docs/privacy-sandbox/fledge-api#try-fledge) explains what FLEDGE
features are currently available for testing in Chrome run from the command line
using [feature flags](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/run-chromium-with-flags).

Features of FLEDGE will be added over time. While the [origin trial](/docs/privacy-sandbox/unified-origin-trial/)
is active, we'll regularly update a list of which features are already
implemented and what's still in progress.

### What browser configuration is available? {: #user-controls}

Users can adjust their participation for Privacy Sandbox trials in Chrome by
enabling or disabling the top-level setting in
`chrome://settings/privacySandbox`. During initial testing, people can use the
Privacy Sandbox setting to opt out of FLEDGE. 

Chrome plans to allow users to see and manage the list of interest groups that
they've been added to, across the sites they've visited.  As with the Privacy
Sandbox technologies, user settings may evolve with feedback from users,
regulators, and others.

We'll update the available settings in Chrome as the FLEDGE proposal
progresses, [based on tests and feedback](/docs/privacy-sandbox/proposal-lifecycle/#testing).
In the future, we'll offer more granular settings to manage FLEDGE and
associated data.

API callers can't access group membership when users browse in Incognito mode,
and membership is removed when users clear their site data.

{% Details %}

{% DetailsSummary %}
### What is an interest group?
{% endDetailsSummary %}

A FLEDGE interest group represents a group of people with a common interest, corresponding to a
[remarketing](/docs/privacy-sandbox/glossary/#remarketing) list.

Every FLEDGE interest group has an owner. Different types of owners will create different types of
interest groups with different use cases.

The owner asks the user's browser to add membership of their interest group by calling the
JavaScript function `navigator.joinAdInterestGroup()`, providing information such as data about ads
relevant to the interest group, and a URL for JavaScript used in bidding. Interest group data
(such as the ads) can be updated, and an interest group can be enabled for up to 30 days.

{% Aside %}

Interest groups are stored in the browser and can make bids in FLEDGE
in-browser auctions, but aren't programmatically 'readable'. In other words
there's no `navigator.getAdInterestGroups()`, as this would expose cross-site
identity.

{% endAside %}

{: #buyer-detail}

{% Details %}

{% DetailsSummary %}
### What is a buyer?
{% endDetailsSummary %}

In FLEDGE, a party that owns an [interest group](#interest-group-detail) and bids in an ad auction.

For example:

* **[Advertiser](/docs/privacy-sandbox/glossary/#advertiser)**: acting for itself.
* **[Demand-Side Platform](/docs/privacy-sandbox/glossary/#dsp)** (DSP): acting for advertisers.
* **Interest group owner**: working for multiple advertisers.

Buyers have three jobs:

* Choose whether to participate in an auction.
* Choose ads and calculate a bid.
* Report the auction outcome.

These jobs are done programmatically, in code provided by the buyer that is run
during a FLEDGE ad auction.

When a buyer asks a user's browser to add an interest group to the groups it is a member of (by calling the
JavaScript function `navigator.joinAdInterestGroup()`) the buyer provides the browser with:
* A URL for bidding code, that will be used when the [seller](/docs/privacy-sandbox/glossary/#seller) runs an [ad auction](/docs/privacy-sandbox/glossary/#ad-auction).
* Potentially, URLs for [ad creatives](/docs/privacy-sandbox/glossary/#creative) for the interest group. (Ad URLs may be added
later via an update.)
* A list of data [keys](#key-value) to be queried, and the URL of the buyer's [Key/Value service](#key-value-service-detail),
to enable bidding code to get realtime data during an auction.

The buyer's code can also include a `reportWin()` function to report the auction outcome.

{% endDetails %}

{: #seller-detail}

{% Details %}

{% DetailsSummary %}
### Who runs an ad auction?
{% endDetailsSummary %}

There are multiple parties that might run an auction to sell ad space.

For example:

* **Content publisher**: acting for itself to host ad content on its website.
* **[Supply-side platform](/docs/privacy-sandbox/glossary/#ssp)** (SSP): working with the publisher and providing other services.
* **Third-party script**: acting for a publisher, to enable participation in ad auctions.

With FLEDGE, an ad space [seller](/docs/privacy-sandbox/glossary/#seller) has three jobs:

* Enforce publisher rules: which buyers and which bids are eligible.
* Run auction logic: JavaScript run in
  [worklets](/docs/privacy-sandbox/glossary/#worklet) to calculate a
  desirability score for each bid.
* Report the auction outcome.

These jobs are done programmatically, in code provided by the seller when it instigates an ad
auction by calling the JavaScript function `navigator.runAdAuction()`.

### How does a FLEDGE ad auction work?

{: #auction-diagram}

The diagram below outlines each stage of a FLEDGE ad auction: <a href="https://wd.imgix.net/image/hVf1flv5Jdag8OQKYqOcJgWUvtz1/M8lyXt6JbwFncB16mTb0.png?auto=format&w=1600"

    width="800", height="481"
    %}
</figure>

<br>

In FLEDGE, an ad auction is a collection of small JavaScript programs the browser runs on the user's
device to choose an ad. To preserve privacy, all ad auction code from the seller and buyers is run
in isolated JavaScript [worklets](/docs/privacy-sandbox/glossary/#worklet) that can't talk to the outside world.

A seller (a publisher or a [supply-side platform](/docs/privacy-sandbox/glossary/#ssp))
initiates a FLEDGE ad auction on a site that sells ad space (such as a news
site). The seller chooses buyers to participate in the auction,
indicates what space is for sale, and provides additional criteria for the ad. Each buyer is the
owner of an interest group.

The seller provides the browser with code to score bids, which includes each bid's value, the
[ad creative](/docs/privacy-sandbox/glossary/#creative) URL, and other data returned from each buyer. During the auction, bidding
code from buyers and bid-scoring code from the seller can receive data from their
[Key/Value services](#key-value-service-detail). Once an ad is chosen and
displayed (in a [fenced frame](/docs/privacy-sandbox/fenced-frame/) to preserve
privacy) the seller and the winning bidder can report the auction result.

1. A user visits a site which displays ads.
2. The seller's code starts an auction. The seller specifies which ad space is
   for sale and who can bid, as well as a method to score those bids.
3. The invited buyer's code executes to generate a bid, URL for a relevant ad
   creative, and other data. The bidding script can query for real-time data,
   such as the remaining ad campaign budget, from the buyer's [Key/Value
   service](#key-value-service-detail).
4. The seller's code scores each bid and selects a winner. This logic uses the
   bid value and other data return a bid's desirability and reject an ad that
   can't beat the contextual ad winner. The seller can use their own
   [Key/Value service](#key-value-service-detail) for real-time data.  Before
   an auction starts, the seller finds the best contextual ad for the available
   ad slot. 
5. The winning ad is returned as an opaque value, which displays in a
   [fenced frame](/docs/privacy-sandbox/fenced-frame/). Both the seller and
   publisher will be unable to view this value.
6. The auction is reported to the seller and winning buyers. 
    {% Aside %}
    The seller's `reportResult()` and buyer's `reportWin()` can include a call to `sendReportTo()`. This is available [temporarily](https://github.com/WICG/turtledove/blob/main/FLEDGE.md#5-event-level-reporting-for-now), until aggregate reporting is available with [Private Aggregation](/docs/privacy-sandbox/private-aggregation).
    
    A reporting mechanism for losing buyers is [under discussion](https://github.com/WICG/turtledove/blob/main/FLEDGE.md#53-losing-bidder-reporting).
    {% endAside %}

{% endDetails %}


{: #key-value-service-detail}

{% Details %}

{% DetailsSummary %}
### What is a FLEDGE Key/Value service?
{% endDetailsSummary %}

FLEDGE Key/Value service allows adtechs to query for realtime data when a bid is made by the buyer, and for sellers to score ads while preserving privacy. FLEDGE Key/Value service is one of the [FLEDGE services](/blog/fledge-service-overview/). 

The Key/Value service is deployed to the adtech's own cloud infrastructure, and the service runs on a [trusted execution environment](/docs/privacy-sandbox/glossary/#trusted-execution-environment). A request to a Key/Value service cannot result in event-level logging or have other side effects. The Key/Value service will also support [user-defined functions (UDFs)](https://github.com/WICG/turtledove/blob/main/FLEDGE_Key_Value_Server_trust_model.md#support-for-user-defined-functions-udfs) that allow adtechs to execute their own custom logic within the Key/Value service. 

{: #key-value}

A buyer or seller provides a list of 'keys' to specify the data they require from a FLEDGE Key/Value service. The Key/Value service responds with a value for each key.

The FLEDGE Key/Value service code is now available in a [Privacy Sandbox GitHub repository](https://github.com/privacysandbox/fledge-key-value-service). This service can be used by Chrome and Android developers. 

Learn more about the FLEDGE Key/Value service from the
[API explainer](https://github.com/WICG/turtledove/blob/main/FLEDGE_Key_Value_Server_API.md)
and the [trust model explainer](https://github.com/privacysandbox/fledge-docs/blob/main/key_value_service_trust_model.md).

{% endDetails %}


{% Details %}

{% DetailsSummary %}
### How is realtime data incorporated into auctions?
{% endDetailsSummary %}

The [buyers](#buyer-detail) or [seller](#seller-detail) in an ad auction may need access to realtime
data. For example, bidders may want to calculate the remaining budget in an ad campaign, or the
seller may be required to check ad creatives against publisher policies.

To meet the privacy requirements of FLEDGE, realtime data required during an ad auction is provided by the [Key/Value service](#key-value-service-detail). When each buyer calls `navigator.joinAdInterestGroup()`,the buyer specifies a Key/Value service URL and specifies the keys to be queried to the service during an auction. Likewise, when the seller runs an ad auction by calling `navigator.runAdAuction()`, the seller provides a URL for its Key/Value service. The seller's Key/Value service will be queried with the render URL of the creative.

For initial testing, ["Bring Your Own Server"](https://github.com/WICG/turtledove/blob/main/FLEDGE.md#3-buyers-provide-ads-and-bidding-functions-byos-for-now) model is used. In the long-term, adtechs will need to use the open-source FLEDGE Key/Value services running in [trusted execution environments](https://github.com/privacysandbox/fledge-docs/blob/main/trusted_services_overview.md#trusted-execution-environment) for retrieving real-time data.

To ensure that the ecosystem has sufficient time to test, we don’t expect to require the use of the open-source Key/Value services or TEEs until sometime after third-party cookie deprecation. We will provide substantial notice for developers to begin testing and adoption before this transition takes place.
