### Before you start

1. Read [Attribution Reporting: summary reports](/docs/privacy-sandbox/attribution-reporting/summary-reports/) and [What you should know about the Attribution Reporting API](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lvrKd5Vv7SYLMGZb0Fz7bpGNEl0LOx9i1waAHw2sUg8/edit) for an introduction.
2. Scan [Strategy and tips for summary reports](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bU0a_njpDcRd9vDR0AJjwJjrf3Or8vAzyfuK8JZDEfo/edit#heading=h.j8m326urvgnt)‚è§in particular the [essential notions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bU0a_njpDcRd9vDR0AJjwJjrf3Or8vAzyfuK8JZDEfo/edit#heading=h.kizul7z2av3y) required for you to make best use of this guide.

## Design decisions

### Core design principle {: #core}

There are
[foundational differences](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lvrKd5Vv7SYLMGZb0Fz7bpGNEl0LOx9i1waAHw2sUg8/edit#heading=h.ktl1cq7bdlk)
between how third-party cookies and summary reports operate. One key difference is the
[noise](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bU0a_njpDcRd9vDR0AJjwJjrf3Or8vAzyfuK8JZDEfo/edit#heading=h.81usg7c4jnsg) added to measurement data in summary reports.

**To access summary report measurement data with higher signal-to-noise
ratios, demand-side platforms (DSPs) and ad measurement providers will need to
work with their advertisers to develop noise management strategies.** To develop these strategies, DSPs and measurement providers need to make design decisions. These decisions revolve around one essential concept:

While the distribution _noise values_ are drawn from, absolutely speaking, only depends on two parameters‚è§[epsilon and the contribution budget](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bU0a_njpDcRd9vDR0AJjwJjrf3Or8vAzyfuK8JZDEfo/edit#heading=h.2994euq95tlo)‚è§**you have a number of other controls at your disposal that will impact the
_signal-to-noise ratios_ of your output measurement data**.

While we expect an iterative process will lead to the best decisions, each variation on these decisions will
lead to a slightly different implementation‚Äîthus these decisions must be taken before writing each code iteration (and before running ads).

### Decision: Dimension granularity {: #dimension-granularity}

{% endAside %}

1. Go to **Advanced** mode.
2. In the **Parameters** side panel, look for **Your conversion data**.
3. Observe the default parameters. By default, the **TOTAL daily
   attributable conversion count** is 1000. This averages to roughly 40 per
   bucket if you use the default setup (default dimensions, default number of
   possible different values for each dimension, Key strategy A). Observe that
   the value is 40 in the input **Average daily attributable conversion count
   PER BUCKET**.
4. Click **Simulate** to run a simulation with the default parameters.
5. In the **Parameters** side panel, look for **Dimensions**. Rename
   _Geography_ to _City_ and change the number of possible different values to 50.
6. Observe how this changes the **Average daily attributable conversion
   count PER BUCKET**. It's now much lower. This is because if you increase
   the number of possible values within this dimension without changing
   anything else, you increase the total number of buckets without changing
   how many conversion events will fall in each bucket.
7. Click **Simulate**.
8. Observe the noise ratios of the resulting simulation: noise ratios are
   now higher than for the previous simulation.

{% endDetails %}
{% endAside %}

Given the [core design principle](#core), small summary values are likely to be
more noisy than large summary values. Therefore, your configuration choice
impacts how many attributed conversion events end up in each bucket (otherwise
referred to as your aggregation key), and that quantity impacts noise in the
final output summary reports.

One design decision that impacts the number of attributed conversion events
within a single bucket is dimension granularity. Consider the following examples
of aggregation keys and their dimensions:

- Approach 1: one key structure with **coarse** dimensions: _Country_ x _Ad Campaign_ (or the largest campaign
  aggregation bucket) x _Product Type_ (out of 10 possible product types)
- Approach 2: one key structure with **granular** dimensions: _City_ x _Creative ID_ x _Product_ (out of 100 possible products)

_City_ is a more granular dimension than _Country_; _Creative ID_ is more granular
than _Campaign_; and _Product_ is more granular than _Product type_. Therefore,
Approach 2 will have a lower number of events (conversions) per bucket (= per
key) in its summary report output than Approach 1. Given that the noise added to
the output is agnostic to the number of events in the bucket, measurement data
in summary reports will be more noisy with Approach 2. **For each advertiser, experiment with various
granularity tradeoffs in the key's design in order to have maximum utility in
the results.**

### Decision: Key structures {: #key-structures}

{% endAside %}

In the **Simple** mode, the default key structure is used. In the **Advanced**
mode, you can experiment with different key structures. Some example dimensions
are included; you can also modify these.

1.  Go to **Advanced** mode.
2.  In the **Parameters** side panel, look for **Key strategy**. Observe
    that the default strategy, named **A** in the tool, uses one granular key
    structure that includes all dimensions: Geography x Campaign ID x Product
    category.
3.  Click **Simulate**.
4.  Observe the noise ratios of the resulting simulation.
5.  Change the **Key strategy** to **B**. This displays additional controls
    for you to configure your key structure.
6.  Configure your key structure e.g. as follows:
    1.  Number of key structures: 2
    2.  Key structure 1 = Geography x Product category.
    3.  Key structure 2 = Campaign ID x Product category.
7.  Click **Simulate**.
8.  Observe that you now get two summary reports per measurement goal type
    (two for purchase count, two for purchase value), given that you're using
    two distinct key structures. Observe their noise ratios.
9.  You can also try this with your own custom dimensions. To do so, look
    for **Data you want to track: Dimensions**. Consider removing the example
    dimensions, and creating your own using the **Add**/**Remove**/**Reset**
    buttons below the last dimension.

{% endDetails %}
{% endAside %}

Another design decision that will impact the number of attributed conversion
events within a single bucket is the
[key structures](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bU0a_njpDcRd9vDR0AJjwJjrf3Or8vAzyfuK8JZDEfo/edit#heading=h.81usg7c4jnsg)
you decide to use. Consider the following examples of aggregation keys:

- One key structure with all dimensions; let's call this Key Strategy A.
- Two key structures, each with a subset of dimensions; let's call this
  Key Strategy B.

{% Img src="image/O2RNUyVSLubjvENAT3e7JSdqSOx1/CRC0p52XoC8wUT9p2TJP.png", alt="Diagram: Buckets for Key strategy A and B", width="800", height="458" %}

Strategy A is simpler‚Äîbut you may need to roll up (sum) the noisy summary values included summary reports to access certain insights. By summing up these values, you're also summing the noise.
With Strategy B, summary values exposed in the summary
reports may already give you the information you need. This means that Strategy B
will likely lead to better signal-to-noise ratios than Strategy A. However, the
noise may already be acceptable with Strategy A, so you may still decide to favor
Strategy A for simplicity.
[Learn more in the detailed example outlining these two strategies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bU0a_njpDcRd9vDR0AJjwJjrf3Or8vAzyfuK8JZDEfo/edit#heading=h.i6ovl4dm1npa).

Key management is a deep topic. A number of elaborate techniques can be
considered to improve signal-to-noise ratios. One is described in [Advanced key
management](#key-management-advanced).

### Decision: Batching frequency {: #batching-frequency}

{% endAside %}

1.  Go to the **Simple** mode (or **Advanced** mode ‚Äî both modes work the
    same way when it comes to batching frequency)
2.  In the **Parameters** side panel, look for **Your aggregation strategy** > **Batching frequency**. This refers to the batching frequency of
    aggregatable reports that is processed with the aggregation service in a
    single job.
3.  Observe the default batching frequency: by default, a **daily** batching
    frequency is simulated.
4.  Click **Simulate**.
5.  Observe the noise ratios of the resulting simulation.
6.  Change the batching frequency to **weekly**.
7.  Observe the noise ratios of the resulting simulation: noise ratios are
    now lower (better) than for the previous simulation.

{% endDetails %}
{% endAside %}

Another design decision that will impact the number of attributed conversion
events within a single bucket is the batching frequency you decide to use. The
batching frequency is how often you process aggregatable reports.\
A report that is scheduled for aggregation more frequently (e.g. each hour) will
have fewer conversion events included than the same report with a less frequent
aggregation schedule (e.g. each week). As a result, the hourly report will have
a higher signal-to-noise ratio than the weekly report, all else being equal. **Experiment with reporting requirements at various frequencies, and assess
signal-to-noise ratios for each.**

Learn more in
[Batching](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bU0a_njpDcRd9vDR0AJjwJjrf3Or8vAzyfuK8JZDEfo/edit#heading=h.pef51jskrx06)
and [Aggregating over longer time periods](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bU0a_njpDcRd9vDR0AJjwJjrf3Or8vAzyfuK8JZDEfo/edit#heading=h.pef51jskrx06).

### Decision: Campaign variables that affect attributable conversions {: #campaign-variables}

While this can be difficult to predict and can have significant variations in
addition to seasonality effects, try and estimate the number of daily
single-touch attributable conversions to the closest power of 10: 10, 100,
1,000, or 10,000.


1. Go to **Advanced** mode.
1. In the **Parameters** side panel, look for **Your conversion data**.
1. Observe the default parameters. By default, the **TOTAL daily
   attributable conversion count** is 1000. This averages to roughly 40 per
   bucket if you use the default setup (default dimensions, default number of
   possible different values for each dimension, Key strategy A). Observe that
   the value is 40 in the input **Average daily attributable conversion count
   PER BUCKET**.
1. Click **Simulate** to run a simulation with the default parameters.
1. Observe the noise ratios of the resulting simulation.
1. Now set the **TOTAL daily attributable conversion count** to 100.
   Observe that this lowers the value of **Average daily attributable
   conversion count PER BUCKET**.
1. Click **Simulate**.
1. Observe that the noise ratios are now higher: this is because when you
   have fewer conversions per bucket, signal-to-noise ratios are likely to be
   higher.

{% endDetails %}
{% endAside %}

An important distinction is the total number of possible conversions for an
advertiser, vs. the total number of possible _attributed_ conversions. The
latter is what ultimately impacts noise in summary reports. Attributed
conversions are a subset of total conversions that are prone to campaign
variables, such as ad budget and ad targeting. For example, you would expect a
higher number of attributed conversions for a $10M ad campaign vs. a $10K ad
campaign, all else being equal.

Things to consider:

- Assess attributed conversions against a single-touch, same device
  attribution model, as these are within the scope of summary reports
  collected with the Attribution Reporting API.
- Consider both a worst-case scenario count and a best-case scenario count
  for attributed conversions. For example, all else being equal, consider the
  minimum and maximum possible campaign budgets for an advertiser, then
  project attributable conversions for both outcomes as inputs into your
  simulation.
- If you're considering using the
  [Android Privacy Sandbox](https://developer.android.com/design-for-safety/privacy-sandbox),
  consider cross-platform attributed conversions in the calculation.

### Decision: Using scaling {: #scaling}

{% Aside %}
{% Details %}
{% DetailsSummary %}

{% Aside %}
New to [Noise Lab](https://noise-lab.uc.r.appspot.com/)? [Take a quick tour](#quick-tour).
{% endAside %}


1.  Go to **Advanced** mode.
1.  In the **Parameters** side panel, look for **Your aggregation strategy** > **Scaling**. It's set to **Yes** by default.
1.  For the sake of understanding the positive effects of scaling on noise
    ratio, first set **Scaling** to **No**.
1.  Click **Simulate**.
1.  Observe the noise ratios of the resulting simulation.
1.  Set **Scaling** to **Yes**. Note that Noise Lab automatically calculates
    the scaling factors to be used given the ranges (average and max values) of
    the measurement goals for your scenario. In a real system or origin trial
    setup, you'd want to implement your own calculation for scaling factors.
1.  Click **Simulate**.
1.  Observe that the noise ratios are now lower (better) in this second
    simulation. This is because you're using scaling.

{% endDetails %}
{% endAside %}

Given the [core design principle](#core), the noise added is
a function of the contribution budget.

Therefore, to increase signal-to-noise ratios, you can decide to transform
values collected during a conversion event by [scaling](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bU0a_njpDcRd9vDR0AJjwJjrf3Or8vAzyfuK8JZDEfo/edit#heading=h.683u7t2q1xk2) them against the
contribution budget (and de-scaling them after aggregation). **Use scaling to increase signal-to-noise ratios**.

### Decision: Number of measurement goals, and privacy budget split {: #goals-and-budget}

This relates to Scaling; make sure to read [Using
scaling](#scaling).

{% endAside %}

A measurement goal is a distinct data point collected in conversion events.


1. Go to **Advanced** mode.
1. In the **Parameters** side panel, look for **Data you want to track:
   Measurement goals**. By default, you have two measurement goals: purchase
   value and purchase count.
1. Click **Simulate** to run a simulation with the default goals.
1. Click **Remove**. This will remove the last measurement goal (purchase
   count in that case).
1. Click **Simulate**.
1. Observe that the noise ratios for the purchase value are now lower
   (better) for this second simulation. This is because you have less
   measurement goals, so your one measurement goal now gets all of the
   contribution budget.
1. Click **Reset**. You now have again two measurement goals: purchase
   value and purchase count. Note that Noise Lab automatically calculates the
   scaling factors to be used given the ranges (average and max values) of the
   measurement goals for your scenario. By default, Noise Lab splits the
   budget equally across measurement goals.
1. Click **Simulate**.
1. Observe the noise ratios of the resulting simulation. Take note of the
   scaling factors displayed on the simulation.
1. Now, let's customize the privacy budget split to achieve better
   signal-to-noise ratios.
1. Tweak the Budget % assigned for each measurement goal. Given the default
   parameters, **Measurement goal 1**, namely **purchase value**, has a much
   wider range (between 0 and 1000) than **Measurement goal 2**, namely
   **purchase count** (between 1 and 1 i.e. always equal to 1). Because of
   this, it needs "more space to scale": it would be ideal to assign more
   contribution budget to **Measurement goal 1** than **Measurement goal 2**, so that
   it can be scaled up more efficiently (see Scaling), and hence
1. Assign 70% of the budget to **Measurement goal 1**. Assign 30% to **Measurement
   goal 2**.
1. Click **Simulate**.
1. Observe the noise ratios of the resulting simulation. For purchase
   value, noise ratios are now notably lower (better) than for the previous
   simulation. For purchase count, they're roughly unchanged.
1. Keep tweaking the budget split across metrics. Observe how this impacts
   noise.

Note that you can set your own custom measurement goals with the
**Add**/**Remove**/**Reset** buttons.

{% endDetails %}
{% endAside %}

If you measure one data point (measurement goal) on a conversion event, such as
conversion count, that data point can get all the contribution budget (65536). If you set multiple measurement goals on a conversion event,
such as conversion count and purchase value, then those data points will need to
share the contribution budget. This means you have less leeway to scale up your
values. 

**Therefore, the more measurement goals you have, the lower signal-to-noise ratios
are likely to be (higher noise)**.

Another decision to make regarding measurement goals is the budget split. If you split the contribution budget equally across two data points, each data point gets a
budget of 65536/2 = 32768. This may or may not be optimal depending on the
maximum possible value for each data point. For example, if you're measuring
purchase count that has a maximum value of 1, and purchase value with a
minimum of 1 and a maximum of 120, the purchase value would benefit from having
"more space" to be scaled up‚Äîthat is, to be given a larger proportion of the
contribution budget. **You'll see if some measurement goals should be prioritized over
others in relation to the impact of noise.**

A measurement goal is a distinct data point collected in conversion events.


1.  Go to **Advanced** mode.
1.  In the **Parameters** side panel, look for **Your aggregation strategy** > **Scaling**.
1.  Make sure **Scaling** is set to **Yes**. Note that Noise Lab
    automatically calculates the scaling factors to be used, based on the
    ranges (average and max values) you have given for the measurement goals.
1.  Let's assume that the largest purchase ever made was $2000, but that
    most purchases happen in the range $10-$120. First, let's see what happens
    if we use a literal scaling approach (not recommended): enter $2000 as the
    max value for purchaseValue.
1.  Click **Simulate**.
1.  Observe that the noise ratios are high. This is because our scaling
    factor is currently calculated based on $2000, when in reality most
    purchase values will be notably lower than that.
1.  Now, let's use a more pragmatic scaling approach. Change the max
    purchase value to $120.
1.  Click **Simulate**.
1.  Observe that the noise ratios are lower (better) in this second simulation.

{% endDetails %}
{% endAside %}

To implement scaling, you would typically calculate a scaling factor based on
the maximum possible value for a given conversion event
([learn more in this example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bU0a_njpDcRd9vDR0AJjwJjrf3Or8vAzyfuK8JZDEfo/edit#heading=h.t7l1v2w2m4a)).\
However, avoid using a literal maximum value to calculate that scaling factor,
as this would worsen your signal-to-noise ratios. **Instead, remove outliers and
use a pragmatic maximum value**.

Outlier management is a deep topic. A number of elaborate techniques can be
considered to improve signal-to-noise ratios. One is described in [Advanced
outlier management](#outlier-management-advanced).

## Next steps

Now that you've assessed various noise management strategies for your use case,
you're ready to start experimenting with summary reports by collecting real
measurement data via an origin trial. Review guides and tips to [Try the API](/docs/privacy-sandbox/attribution-reporting-experiment/#try-the-api).

### Noise Lab quick tour {: #quick-tour}

{% endDetailsSummary %}

{% Aside 'caution' %}
**Noise Lab is experimental**. Do not expect the output summary values to be completely accurate. Instead, use the tool as a first step for quick exploration. Expect
quirks.
{% endAside %}

[Noise Lab](https://noise-lab.uc.r.appspot.com/) helps you quickly
assess and compare noise management strategies. Use it to:

- **Understand** the main parameters that can impact noise, and the
  effect they have.
- **Simulate** the effect of noise on the output measurement data given
  different design decisions. Tweak design parameters until you reach a
  signal-to-noise ratio that works for your use case.
- **Share your feedback** on the utility of the summary reports: which
  values of epsilon and noise parameters work for you, which don't? Where are
  the inflection points?

Think of this as a preparation step before running an origin trial. Noise Lab
generates measurement data to simulate summary report outputs based on your
input. It does not persist or share any data.

There are two different modes in Noise Lab:

- **Simple mode**: understand the fundamentals of the controls you have
  on noise.
- **Advanced mode**: test different noise management strategies and assess
  which one leads to the best signal-to-noise ratios for your use cases.

Click on the buttons in the top menu to toggle between the two modes (_#1. in the screenshot below_).

#### Simple mode

- With Simple mode, you control **Parameters** (found on the left-hand
  side, or _#2. in the screenshot below_) such as Epsilon, and see how they impact noise.
- Each parameter has a tooltip (a `?` button). Click these to see an
  explanation of each parameter (#_3. in the screenshot below_)
- To start, click the "Simulate" button and observe what the output looks
  like (#_4. in the screenshot below_)
- In the **Output** section you can see a variety of details. Some
  elements have a `?` next to it. Take the time to click each `?` to see an
  explanation of the various pieces of information.
  - Within the **Output** section, click on the **Details** toggle
    if you want to see an expanded version of the table (#_5. in the screenshot below)_
  - Below each data table in the output section, there is an option
    to download the table for offline usage. Additionally, in the bottom
    right corner there is an option to download all data tables (#_6. in
    the screenshot below_)
- Test different settings for the parameters in the **Parameters** section
  and click **Simulate** to see how they impact the output:

### Advanced key management {: #key-management-advanced}

{% endDetailsSummary %}

A DSP or ad measurement company might have thousands of global advertising
customers, spanning multiple industries, currencies, and purchase price
potentials. This means that creating and managing one aggregation key per
advertiser will likely be highly impractical. Additionally, it will be
challenging to select a max aggregatable value and aggregation budget that can
limit the impact of noise across these thousands of global advertisers. Instead,
let's consider the following scenarios:

#### Key Strategy A

The adtech provider decides to create and manage **one key** across all of its
advertising customers. Across all advertisers and all currencies, the range of
purchases vary from low volume, high-end purchases to high volume, low-end
purchases. This results in the following key:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th>Key (multiple currencies)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Max aggregatable value</td>
      <td>5,000,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Purchase value range</td>
      <td>[120 - 5000000]</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### Key Strategy B

The adtech provider decides to create and manage **two keys** across all of its
advertising customers. They decide to separate keys by currency. Across all
advertisers and all currencies, the range of purchases vary from low volume,
high-end purchases to high volume, low-end purchases. Separating by currency,
they create 2 keys:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th>Key 1 (USD)</th>
      <th>Key 2 (¬•)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Max aggregatable value</td>
      <td>$40,000</td>
      <td>¬•5,000,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Purchase value range</td>

Key Strategy B will have less noise in its result than Key Strategy A, because
currency values are not uniformly distributed across currencies. For example,
consider how purchases denominated in ¬• co-mingled with purchases denominated in
USD will alter the underlying data and resulting noisy output.

#### Key Strategy C

The adtech provider decides to create and manage **four keys** across all of
its advertising customers, and to separate them by Currency x Advertiser
industry:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th>Key 1 <br>
(USD x High-end jewelry advertisers)</th>
      <th>Key 2 <br>
(¬• x High-end jewelry advertisers)</th>
      <th>Key 3 <br>
(USD x Clothing retailer advertisers)</th>
      <th>Key 4 <br>
(¬• x Clothing retailer advertisers)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Max aggregatable value</td>
      <td>$40,000</td>
      <td>¬•5,000,000</td>
      <td>$500</td>
      <td>¬•65,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Purchase value range</td>
      <td>[10,000 - 40,000]</td>
      <td>[1,250,000 - 5,000,000]</td>
      <td>[120 - 500]</td>
      <td>[15,000 - 65,000]</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Key Strategy C will have less noise in its result than Key Strategy B, because
advertiser purchase values are not uniformly distributed across advertisers. For
example, consider how purchases for high end jewelry co-mingled with purchases
for baseball hats will alter the underlying data and resulting noisy output.

Consider creating shared maximum aggregate values and shared scaling factors
for commonalities across multiple advertisers in order to reduce noise in the
output. For example, you could experiment with different strategies below for
your advertisers:

- One strategy separated by **currency** (USD, ¬•, CAD, etc)
- One strategy separated by **advertiser industry** (Insurance, Auto,
  Retail, etc)
- One strategy separated by **similar purchase value ranges** ([100],
  [1000], [10000], etc)

By creating key strategies around advertiser commonalities, keys and the
corresponding code are easier to manage, and the signal-to-noise ratios become
higher. Experiment with different strategies with different advertiser
commonalities to uncover inflection points in maximizing noise impact vs code
management.

### Advanced outlier management {: #outlier-management-advanced}

{% endDetailsSummary %}

Let's consider a scenario across two advertisers:

- **Advertiser A:**
  - Across all products on Advertiser A's site, the purchase price
    possibilities are between [$120 - $1,000] , for a range of $880.
  - Purchase prices are evenly distributed across the $880 range
    with no outliers outside two standard deviations from the median purchase price.
- **Advertiser B:**
  - Across all products on Advertiser B's site, the purchase price
    possibilities are between [$120 - $1,000] , for a range of $880.
  - Purchase prices heavily skew towards the range of $120 - $500,
    with only 5% of purchases occurring in the $500 - $1,000 range.

Given the
[contribution budget requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bU0a_njpDcRd9vDR0AJjwJjrf3Or8vAzyfuK8JZDEfo/edit#heading=h.pcbjmxqyvd83)
and the methodology with which
[noise is applied](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bU0a_njpDcRd9vDR0AJjwJjrf3Or8vAzyfuK8JZDEfo/edit#heading=h.u6r748h70ivc)
to the end results, Advertiser B will, by default, have a noisier output than
Advertiser A, as Advertiser B has a higher potential for outliers to impact the
underlying calculations.

It's possible to mitigate this with a specific key setup. Test key strategies
that help to manage outlier data, and to more evenly distribute purchase values
across the purchase range of the key.

For Advertiser B, you could create two separate keys to capture two different
purchase value ranges. In this example, the adtech has noted that outliers
appear above the $500 purchase value. Try implementing two separate keys for
this advertiser:

- **Key Structure 1** : Key that only captures purchases between the
  range of $120 - $500 (covering ~95% of total purchase volume).
- **Key Structure 2**: Key that only captures purchases above $500
  (covering ~5% of total purchase volume).

Implementing this key strategy should better manage noise for Advertiser B and
help to maximize utility for them from summary reports. Given the new smaller
ranges, Key A and Key B should now have a more uniform distribution of data
across each respective key that for the previous single key. This will result in
less noise impact in each key's output that for the previous single key.
