## Implementation status

This document outlines a new proposal for unpartitioned storage: the Shared
Storage API.

*  The [Shared Storage proposal](https://github.com/WICG/shared-storage)
   has entered [public discussion](https://github.com/WICG/shared-storage/issues).
*  We're [implementing this API in Chrome version 104](#try-the-shared-storage-api).
   *  The initial origin trial will only include the
      `runURLSelectionOperation`. Support for the Private Aggregation API will
      come shortly after.
   *  The `selectURL` API is available for testing in Chrome Canary as of M104.
*  [The Privacy Sandbox timeline](http://privacysandbox.com/timeline)
   provides implementation timings for the Shared Storage API and other
   Privacy Sandbox proposals.

## Why do we need this API?

To prevent cross-site user tracking, browsers are 
[partitioning](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/01/building-more-private-web-path-towards.html)
all forms of storage (cookies, localStorage, caches, etc). However, there are
a number of legitimate use cases that rely on unpartitioned storage which
would be impossible without help from new web APIs. For example, an advertiser
may want to measure reach of an ad campaign across different sites, while
preserving individual user privacy and identity.

The proposed Shared Storage API will allow sites to store and access
unpartitioned cross-site data. This data must be read in a secure environment
to prevent leakage. This API will work in combination with other proposals,
such as [Trust Tokens](/docs/privacy-sandbox/trust-tokens/),
[Fenced Frames](/docs/privacy-sandbox/fenced-frame/), and others.

### Who is this for?

Many different organizations may benefit from using the Shared Storage API. For
example:

*  Adtechs to solve many common ads use cases which currently rely on
   third-party cookies.
*  Payments providers to understand if the user is an existing customer and
   tailor the checkout experience.
*  Web security companies who use custom on-device logic to flag suspicious or
   dangerous behavior.

## Use cases for Shared Storage

The Shared Storage API intends to support many use cases, replacing several
existing uses for third-party cookies. This may include:

*  Recording aggregated statistics, such as demographics, reach, frequency
   measurement, and conversion measurement with the
   [Private Aggregation API](https://github.com/alexmturner/private-aggregation-api)
*  Frequency capping
*  Lift experiments
*  A/B experiments
*  Creative rotation
*  Confirm login for payment provider
*  User consent status

The proposal intends to create a general purpose API which supports many
possible future use cases. This allows for further experimentation and change,
to grow alongside the web ecosystem.

## How will shared storage work?

Shared storage will allow you to make informed decisions based on cross-site
data, without sharing user information (such as browser history or other
personal details) with an embedding site. You can write to  shared storage at
any time, like other JavaScript storage APIs (like localStorage or indexedDB).
Unlike the other storage APIs, you can only read the shared storage values in
a secure environment, known as a shared storage worklet.

The shared storage data can be used for:

*  [**URL selection**](/docs/privacy-sandbox/use-shared-storage#url-selection): 
   you can run a worklet script to select a URL from a provided list, based on
   the stored data, and then render that URL in a fenced frame.  The returned
   URL will be an opaque URL, which means the developer and other viewers of
   the code won't know which URL was selected.
*  [**Noisy aggregation of cross-site data**](/docs/privacy-sandbox/use-shared-storage#aggregated-data):
   you will be able to run a worklet script to send your data through the
   [Private Aggregation API](https://github.com/alexmturner/private-aggregation-api),
   a Privacy Sandbox proposal, which returns a privacy-preserving report. 

## Try the Shared Storage API

Shared Storage API with Fenced Frames can be tested in Chrome 104 (version
104.0.5086.0 or later) by enabling the **Privacy Sandbox Ads APIs experiment**
flag at `chrome://flags/#privacy-sandbox-ads-apis`.

## Engage and share feedback

The shared storage proposal is under active discussion and subject to change
in the future. If you try this API and have feedback, we'd love to hear it.

*  **GitHub**: Read the
   [proposal](https://github.com/pythagoraskitty/shared-storage), [raise questions and participate in discussion](https://github.com/pythagoraskitty/shared-storage/issues).
*  **Developer support**: Ask questions and join discussions on the
   [Privacy Sandbox Developer Support repo](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/privacy-sandbox-dev-support).
