## Why do we need the Privacy Sandbox?

The Privacy Sandbox initiative has two core aims:
* Develop replacement solutions to support web use cases and business models without enabling users 
to be tracked across sites, and avoiding cross-site tracking users aren't aware of.
* Phase out support for third-party cookies when new solutions are in place.


## Who is working on the Privacy Sandbox?

Chrome and other ecosystem stakeholders have offered more than 30 proposals to date, which can be 
found in the [public resources of W3C groups](https://github.com/w3c/web-advertising#ideas-and-proposals-links-outside-this-repo). These proposals cover a wide variety of use cases and requirements.


## When will the APIs be implemented?

The [implementation status](/docs/privacy-sandbox/status/) page on this site provides progress 
updates for individual APIs.
