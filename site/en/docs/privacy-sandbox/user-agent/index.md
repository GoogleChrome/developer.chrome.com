## Implementation status

*  [Origin trial](/blog/user-agent-reduction-origin-trial/) Chrome 95 to 103
*  [Deprecation trial](/blog/user-agent-reduction-deprecation-trial/) Chrome 103 to Chrome 112
*  [Chrome DevTools integration](/blog/new-in-devtools-89/#ua-ch)
*  Review the [UA-CH Chrome platform status](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5995832180473856)

## What is User-Agent reduction?

User-Agent (UA) reduction is the effort to minimize the identifying information
shared in the User-Agent string which may be [used for passive
fingerprinting](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/unsanctioned-tracking/#unsanctioned-tracking-tracking-without-user-control).
As these [changes are rolled
out](https://blog.chromium.org/2021/09/user-agent-reduction-origin-trial-and-dates.html), 
all resource requests will have a reduced `User-Agent` header. As a result,
the return values from certain `Navigator` interfaces will be reduced,
including: `navigator.userAgent`, `navigator.appVersion`, and
`navigator.platform`.

Web developers should [prepare for the reduced User-Agent
string](#prepare-and-test) by reviewing their site code for instances and uses
of the User-Agent string. If your site relies on parsing the User-Agent string
to read the device model, platform version, or full browser version, you'll
need to [implement the User-Agent Client Hints
API](https://web.dev/migrate-to-ua-ch/).

[Review the latest timeline](https://www.chromium.org/updates/ua-reduction) for
User-Agent reduction.

{% Aside 'key-term' %}
The [`User-Agent` string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent)
is an HTTP request header which allows servers and networks to identify the
application, operating system (OS), vendor, and / or version of a user agent.
Currently, the `User-Agent` is shared on every HTTP request and exposed in
JavaScript.
{% endAside %}

### User-Agent Client Hints (UA-CH)

[User-Agent Client Hints](https://wicg.github.io/ua-client-hints/) allow access
to the full set of user-agent data, but only when servers actively declare an
explicit need for specific pieces of data.

By removing passively exposed user-data, we can better measure and reduce the
amount of information that is intentionally exposed by request headers,
JavaScript APIs, and other mechanisms.

## Why do we need reduced UA and UA-CH?

Currently, the User-Agent string broadcasts a large string of data about a
user's browser, operating system, and version every HTTP request. This is
problematic for two reasons:

*  The granularity and abundance of detail can lead to user identification.
*  The default availability of this information can lead to covert tracking.

We improve user privacy by only sharing basic information by default.

The reduced User-Agent includes the browser's brand and a significant version,
where the request came from (desktop or mobile), and the platform. To access
more data, User-Agent Client Hints allow you to request specific information
about the user's device or conditions. 

Further, the `User-Agent` string has grown longer and more complex, which led
to error-prone string parsing. UA-CH provides structured and reliable data that
is easier to interpret. Existing code which parses the UA string shouldn't
break (though it will return less data), and you'll need to migrate to UA-CH
if your site [needs specific information
information](https://wicg.github.io/ua-client-hints/#use-cases).

## How does the reduced UA and UA-CH work?

Here is a brief example of how the reduced User-Agent string and UA-CH work.
For a more in-depth example, review [Improving user privacy and developer
experience with User-Agent Client Hints](https://web.dev/user-agent-client-hints/#example-exchange).

A user opens the browser and enters `example.com` into the address bar:

1. The browser sends a request to load the webpage.
   1. The browser includes the `User-Agent` header with the reduced User-Agent
      string. For example:
      `User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 10; K) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML,
      like Gecko) Chrome/98.0.0.0 Mobile Safari/537.36`
   1. The browser includes that same information in the default User-Agent
      Client Hint headers. For example:
      ```powershell
      Sec-CH-UA: "Chrome"; v="98"
      Sec-CH-UA-Mobile: ?1
      Sec-CH-UA-Platform: "Android"
      ```
1. The server can ask the browser to send additional client hints with the
   `Accept-CH` response header, such as the device model. For example:
   `Accept-CH: Sec-CH-UA, Sec-CH-UA-Mobile, Sec-CH-UA-Platform, Sec-CH-UA-Model`
1. The browser applies policies and user configuration to determine what data
   is allowed to return to the server in subsequent request headers. For
   example:
   ```powershell
   Sec-CH-UA: "Chrome"; v="93"
   Sec-CH-UA-Mobile: ?1
   Sec-CH-UA-Platform: "Android"
   Sec-CH-UA-Model: "Pixel 2"
   ```

### Critical Client Hints

If you need a specific set of Client Hints in your initial request, you can use
the `Critical-CH` response header. `Critical-CH` values must be a subset of the
values requested by `Accept-CH`.

For example, the initial request may include a request for `Device-Memory` and
`Viewport-Width`, where `Device-Memory` is considered critical.

```powershell
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Accept-CH: Device-Memory, Viewport-Width
Vary: Device-Memory, Viewport-Width
Critical-CH: Device-Memory
```

If, after processing the `Accept-CH header`, the client would send a critical
hint, the client retries the request.

In summary, `Accept-CH` requests all values you'd like for the page, while `Critical-CH`
requests only the subset of values you must have on-load to properly load the
page. Refer to the [Client Hints Reliability
specification](https://github.com/WICG/client-hints-infrastructure/blob/main/reliability.md)
for more information.

## How do I prepare for reduced UA? {: #prepare-and-test}

As we get closer to scaled availability of the reduced User-Agent string, [review your site
code](https://web.dev/migrate-to-ua-ch/#audit-collection-and-use-of-user-agent-data)
for instances and uses of the User-Agent string. If your site relies on parsing
the User-Agent string to read the device model, platform version, or full
browser version, you'll need to
[implement the UA-CH API](https://web.dev/migrate-to-ua-ch/).

Once you've updated to the UA-CH API, you should test to ensure you get the
data you expect from the User-Agent. There are three ways to test, each
increasing in complexity.

Scaled availability for User-Agent reduction means the fully reduced UA string
shipped on all Chrome devices. Reduction is planned to begin with a Chrome
minor release in Q2 of 2022.

### Test the string locally {: #test-locally}

There are a couple of methods to test the reduced User-Agent locally:

* Enable the `chrome://flags/#reduce-user-agent` flag.
    * This will set your local browser to receive just the reduced `user-agent`
      string for all sites, before it becomes the default setting.
* Configure an emulated device in DevTools with the right `user-agent` string
  and client hints.
    * In the top right of DevTools, click
      {% Img src="image/admin/CBHNS0GIpZlOcDkO1D7F.png", alt="", width="28", height="28" %} 
      **Settings** > **Devices** > **Add custom device...** to configure an
      emulated device with any combination of `user-agent` string and
      User-Agent Client Hints values you need. 
    * In the top left of DevTools, click 
      {% Img src="image/admin/9FiBHFCzfPgP8sy6LMx7.png", alt="", width="30", height="32" %}
      **Toggle Device Toolbar** to open the DevTools UI to emulate a device.
* Launch Chrome with the `--user-agent="Custom string here"`.
    * Use this [command line
      flag](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/run-chromium-with-flags)
      to run Chrome with a custom user-agent string.

### Transform the string in your site's code

If you process the existing Chrome `user-agent` string in your client-side or
server-side code, you can transform that string to the new format to test
compatibility. You can test by either overriding and replacing the string, or
generating the new version and test side-by-side.

Review these [User-Agent reduction
snippets](/docs/privacy-sandbox/user-agent/snippets/) for example regular
expressions.

### Test on real user traffic with an  origin trial

[Register for the Chrome origin trial](/origintrials/#/view_trial/-7123568710593282047)
to test the reduced User-Agent with your platform on real user traffic.

If you create content that is embedded onto other websites (in other words,
3rd-party content), then you can participate in a [third-party origin
trial](/blog/third-party-origin-trials/) and test this change across multiple
sites. When you register for the Chrome origin trial, select the "third-party
matching" option to allow the script to be injected when your site is embedded
on third-parties.

## Support for Client Hints and critical hints

There are three [default Client Hints](https://web.dev/migrate-to-ua-ch/#are-you-only-using-basic-user-agent-data)
returned to the server, including browser name and major version, a boolean
which indicates if the browser is on a mobile device, and the operating system
name. These are sent after the TLS handshake. These are already available and
supported in your browser.

However, there may be some times when you need to retrieve critical information
for your site to render.

### Optimize critical hints

{% Aside 'warning' %}

Using critical hints should be rare, so make sure you've reviewed the reason
for implementation. The question to ask yourself is, do you require extended
data on the initial page load? Will your page fail to load without this
information?

{% endAside %}

A Transport Layer Security protocol (TLS) handshake is the first step to create
a secure connection between the browser and web server. Without an
intervention, the
[Critical-CH response header](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-davidben-http-client-hint-reliability-03.html#name-the-critical-ch-response-he)
was designed to tell the browser to immediately retry the request if the first
one was sent without a critical hint.

<figure>
   {% Img src="image/VbsHyyQopiec0718rMq2kTE1hke2/2HXNm4tcNZzOWIzy7pH0.png", alt="Sequence diagram for Client Hints with critical hints", width="800", height="934" %}
  <figcaption>When a critical hint is requested by the server, the client will retry sending the first request for the webpage with the critical hint. In this example, the hint for <code>Sec-CH-UA-Model</code> is requested twice: once as a Client Hint with <code>Accept-CH</code> and again as a critical hint with <code>Critical-CH</code>.</figcaption>
</figure>

To optimize critical hints ([`Critical-CH` header](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/zPYGbULXn7o/m/q3OJ2kZAAQAJ)),
you must intercept this handshake and provide a model for Client Hints. These
steps may be complex, and require advanced knowledge.

The [`ACCEPT_CH` HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 frames](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-davidben-http-client-hint-reliability-02#section-4),
combined with the [TLS ALPS extension](https://github.com/vasilvv/tls-alps),
are a connection-level optimization to deliver the server’s Client Hint
preferences in time for the first HTTP request. These require complex
configuration, and we recommend only using this for truly critical information.
BoringSSL (a fork of OpenSSL) helps you work with Google’s experimental
features in Chromium. At this time, ALPS is only
[implemented in BoringSSL](https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-boringssl-docs/ssl.h.html#Application-layer-protocol-settings).
