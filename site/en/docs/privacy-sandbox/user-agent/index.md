*  [UA-CH Chrome platform status](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5995832180473856)

## What is User-Agent reduction?

User-Agent (UA) reduction is the effort to minimize the identifying information
shared in the User-Agent string which may be [used for passive
fingerprinting](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/unsanctioned-tracking/#unsanctioned-tracking-tracking-without-user-control).
As these [changes are rolled
out](https://blog.chromium.org/2021/09/user-agent-reduction-origin-trial-and-dates.html), 
all resource requests will have a reduced `User-Agent` header. As a result,
the return values from certain `Navigator` interfaces will be reduced,
including: `navigator.userAgent`, `navigator.appVersion`, and
`navigator.platform`.

Web developers should [prepare for the reduced User-Agent
string](#prepare-and-test) by reviewing their site code for instances and uses
of the User-Agent string. If your site relies on parsing the User-Agent string
to read the device model, platform version, or full browser version, you'll
need to [implement the User-Agent Client Hints
API](https://web.dev/migrate-to-ua-ch/).

[Review the latest timeline](https://www.chromium.org/updates/ua-reduction) for
User-Agent reduction.

{% Aside 'key-term' %}
The [`User-Agent` string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent)
is an HTTP request header which allows servers and networks to identify the
application, operating system (OS), vendor, and / or version of a user agent.
Currently, the `User-Agent` is shared on every HTTP request and exposed in
JavaScript.
{% endAside %}

### User-Agent Client Hints (UA-CH)

[User-Agent Client Hints](https://wicg.github.io/ua-client-hints/) allow access
to the full set of user-agent data, but only when servers actively declare an
explicit need for specific pieces of data.

By removing passively exposed user-data, we can better measure and reduce the
amount of information that is intentionally exposed by request headers,
JavaScript APIs, and other mechanisms.

## Why do we need reduced UA and UA-CH?

Currently, the User-Agent string broadcasts a large string of data about a
user's browser, operating system, and version every HTTP request. This is
problematic for two reasons:

*  The granularity and abundance of detail can lead to user identification.
*  The default availability of this information can lead to covert tracking.

We improve user privacy by only sharing basic information by default.

The reduced User-Agent includes the browser's brand and a significant version,
where the request came from (desktop or mobile), and the platform. To access
more data, User-Agent Client Hints allow you to request specific information
about the user's device or conditions. 

Further, the `User-Agent` string has grown longer and more complex, which led
to error-prone string parsing. UA-CH provides structured and reliable data that
is easier to interpret. Existing code which parses the UA string shouldn’t
break (though it will return less data), and you’ll need to migrate to UA-CH
if your site [needs specific information
information](https://wicg.github.io/ua-client-hints/#use-cases).

## How do the reduced UA and UA-CH work?

Here is a brief example of how the reduced User-Agent string and UA-CH work.
For a more in-depth example, review [Improving user privacy and developer
experience with User-Agent Client Hints](https://web.dev/user-agent-client-hints/#example-exchange).

1. A user opens the browser and enters `example.com` into the address bar.
1. The browser sends a request to load the webpage.
   1. The browser includes the `User-Agent` header with the reduced User-Agent
      string. For example:
      `User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 10; K) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML,
      like Gecko) Chrome/93.0.0.0 Mobile Safari/537.36`
   1. The browser includes that same information in the default User-Agent Client
      Hint headers. For example:
      ```powershell
      Sec-CH-UA: "Chrome"; v="93"
      Sec-CH-UA-Mobile: ?1
      Sec-CH-UA-Platform: "Android"
      ```
1. The server can ask the browser to send additional client hints with the
   `Accept-CH` response header. For example:
   `Accept-CH: Sec-CH-UA-Arch`
1. The browser applies policies and user configuration to determine what data
   is allowed to return to the server in subsequent request headers. For
   example:
   ```powershell
   Sec-CH-UA: "Chrome"; v="93"
   Sec-CH-UA-Mobile: ?1
   Sec-CH-UA-Platform: "Android"
   Sec-CH-UA-Arch: "arm"
   ```

If you need a specific set of Client Hints on your initial request, refer to
[Client Hints Reliability](https://github.com/WICG/client-hints-infrastructure/blob/main/reliability.md)
to ensure Client Hints are available on site load and optimized.

## How do I prepare for reduced UA? {: #prepare-and-test}

As we get closer to the rollout of the reduced User-Agent string in Chrome
Stable, [review your site
code](https://web.dev/migrate-to-ua-ch/#audit-collection-and-use-of-user-agent-data)
for instances and uses of the User-Agent string. If your site relies on parsing
the User-Agent string to read the device model, platform version, or full
browser version, you’ll need to
[implement the UA-CH API](https://web.dev/migrate-to-ua-ch/).

Once you’ve updated to the UA-CH API, you should test to ensure you get the
data you expect from the User-Agent. There are three ways to test, each
increasing in complexity.

### Test the string locally {: #test-locally}

There are a couple of methods to test the reduced User-Agent locally:

* Enable the `chrome://flags/#reduce-user-agent` flag.
    * This will set your local browser to receive just the reduced `user-agent`
      string for all sites, before it becomes the default setting.
* Configure an emulated device in DevTools with the right `user-agent` string
  and client hints.
    * In the top right of DevTools, click
      {% Img src="image/admin/CBHNS0GIpZlOcDkO1D7F.png", alt="", width="28", height="28" %} 
      **Settings** > **Devices** > **Add custom device...** to configure an
      emulated device with any combination of `user-agent` string and
      User-Agent Client Hints values you need. 
    * In the top left of DevTools, click 
      {% Img src="image/admin/9FiBHFCzfPgP8sy6LMx7.png", alt="", width="30", height="32" %}
      **Toggle Device Toolbar** to open the DevTools UI to emulate a device.
* Launch Chrome with the `--user-agent="Custom string here"`.
    * Use this [command line
      flag](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/run-chromium-with-flags)
      to run Chrome with a custom user-agent string.

### Transform the string in your site’s code

If you process the existing Chrome `user-agent` string in your client-side or
server-side code, you can transform that string to the new format to test
compatibility. You can test by either overriding and replacing the string, or
generating the new version and test side-by-side.

Review these [User-Agent reduction
snippets](/docs/privacy-sandbox/user-agent/snippets/) for example regular
expressions.

### Test on real user traffic with an  origin trial

[Register for the Chrome origin trial](/origintrials/#/view_trial/-7123568710593282047)
to test the reduced User-Agent with your platform on real user traffic.

If you create content that is embedded onto other websites (in other words,
3rd-party content), then you can participate in a [third-party origin
trial](/blog/third-party-origin-trials/) and test this change across multiple
sites. When you register for the Chrome origin trial, select the "third-party
matching" option to allow the script to be injected when your site is embedded
on third-parties.
