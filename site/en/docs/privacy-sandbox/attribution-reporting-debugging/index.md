Browsers are restricting access to third-party cookies, as these can be
used to track users across sites and hinder user privacy. The
[Attribution Reporting API](/docs/privacy-sandbox/attribution-reporting/)
enables those measurements in a privacy-preserving way, without third-party
cookies. Testers can use debug reports to understand gaps in measurement
results between cookie-based implementation and Attribution Reporting reports.
