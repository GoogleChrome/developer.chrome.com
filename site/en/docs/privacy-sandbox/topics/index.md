## Implementation status

This document outlines a new proposal for interest-based advertising: the Topics API.

-  The [Topics API proposal](https://github.com/jkarlin/topics) has entered [public
   discussion](https://github.com/jkarlin/topics/issues).
-  This proposal needs your feedback. If you have comments, please create an issue on the [Topics
   Explainer repository](https://github.com/jkarlin/topics) or participate in discussions in the
   [Improving Web Advertising Business Group](https://www.w3.org/community/web-adv/participants).
   The explainer has a number of [open questions](https://github.com/jkarlin/topics/issues) that
   still require further definition.
-  The API has not yet been implemented in any browser.
-  [The Privacy Sandbox timeline](http://privacysandbox.com/timeline) provides implementation
   timings for the Topics API and other Privacy Sandbox proposals.

## Why do we need this API?

The Topics API is a [Privacy Sandbox](/docs/privacy-sandbox/overview/) proposal
for a mechanism to enable interest-based advertising, without having to resort to tracking the sites
a user visits.

{% Aside %}

**Interest-based advertising (IBA)** is a form of personalized advertising in which an ad is
selected for a user based on their interests, inferred from the sites they've recently visited.
This is different from contextual advertising, which aims to match content on the page the user
is visiting.

IBA can help advertisers to reach potential customers and help fund websites that cannot
otherwise easily monetize visits to their site purely via contextual advertising. IBA can also
supplement contextual information for the current page to help find an appropriate advertisement
for the visitor.

{% endAside %}

The Topics API proposes a way to provide topics that a user might currently be interested in, based
on their recent browsing activity. These topics can supplement contextual information to help select
appropriate advertisements.
The Topics API has three main tasks:

-  Map website hostnames to topics of interest. For example, a yoga website might be classified
   as being related to "Fitness".
-  Calculate the top topics for a user based on their recent browsing activity.
-  Provide a JavaScript API to provide topics currently of interest to the user, to help enable
   the selection of appropriate ads.

The Topics API can help facilitate robust user controls, as the API is built on top of recognizable,
high-level topics. Chrome plans to offer users the option to remove individual topics, and to show
the user the topics stored in the browser.

## How would topics be curated and selected?

Topics would be selected from a
[taxonomy](https://github.com/jkarlin/topics/blob/main/taxonomy_v1.md): a list of items such as
"Country Music", "Make-Up&nbsp;&&nbsp;Cosmetics" or "Vegetarian Cuisine". These topics would initially be
curated by Chrome for testing, but with the goal that the topic taxonomy becomes a resource
maintained by trusted ecosystem contributors. The taxonomy needs to provide a set of topics that is
small enough in number (currently proposed to be around 350, though we expect the final number of
topics to be between a few hundred and a few thousand) so that many browsers will be associated with
each topic. To avoid sensitive categories, these topics must be public, human-curated, and kept
updated. The initial taxonomy proposed for testing by Chrome has been human-curated [to exclude
categories generally considered sensitive](#sensitive-topics), such as ethnicity or sexual
orientation.

The Topics API proposes using
[machine learning](https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/machine-learning/what-is-machine-learning-infographic/)
to infer topics from hostnames. The classifier model for this would initially be trained by the
browser vendor, or a trusted third party, using human-curated hostnames and topics. The model would
be distributed with the browser, so it would be openly developed and freely available. The browser,
on the user's device, could then use the model to calculate the most popular topics for a user,
based on the [hostnames](https://web.dev/same-site-same-origin/#origin) of the sites recently
visited.
The diagram below outlines a simplified example, showing how the Topics API might help an adtech
platform to select an appropriate ad. This example assumes that the user's browser already has a
model to map website hostnames to topics.

## How does the Topics API work?

{% Aside %}

The Topics API proposal is at the
[initial discussion phase](/docs/privacy-sandbox/cds21-update/#discussion)
to gather and act on feedback from the ecosystem.

The API design is not final and the details below will change as discussions progress.

{% endAside %}

A mechanism to facilitate interest-based advertising, such as the Topics API, must ensure that the
topics of interest it provides are kept up to date.

{: #epoch}

With the Topics API proposal, the browser would infer topics for a user based on their browsing
activity during a period of time known as an _epoch_, currently proposed to be one week. The topic
selected for each epoch would be randomly selected from the user's top five topics for that time
period. To further enhance privacy and ensure that all topics may be represented, there is a 5%
chance the topic is randomly selected from all possible topics in the Taxonomy.

The Topics JavaScript API has one method: `document.browsingTopics()`. This returns an array of
up to three topics, one for each of the three most recent epochs, in random order.

The Topics explainer proposes that each topic object in the array returned by
`document.browsingTopics()` would have three properties:

-  `value`: a number identifying the topic in the taxonomy
-  `taxonomyVersion`: a string identifying the set of topics currently in use by the browser
-  `classifierVersion`: a string identifying the machine-learning classifier used to infer site
topics from hostnames

{% Aside %}

The design of the Topics API is currently under discussion as an
[explainer](https://github.com/jkarlin/topics), which is only the first step in the
standardization process. The API is not finalized.

The parameters described in this article, and details of the API (such as taxonomy size, the
number of topics calculated per week and the number of topics returned per call) are subject to
change as we incorporate ecosystem feedback and iterate on the API.

{% endAside %}

{: #observed-topics}

### API callers only receive topics they've observed

A design goal of the Topics API is to enable interest-based advertising without the sharing of
information to more entities than is currently possible with third-party cookies. The Topics API
proposes that topics can only be returned for API callers that have already observed them, within a
limited timeframe.

{: #caller}

{% Aside 'key-term' %}

A Topics API **caller** is the entity that _calls_ the `document.browsingTopics()` JavaScript
method, and will use the topics returned by the method to help select relevant ads.
Typically, a call to `document.browsingTopics()` would be from code included in a site from a
third party such as an adtech platform. The browser determines the caller from the site of the
current document. So, if you're a third party on a page, make sure you call the API from an
iframe that your site owns.

In order for  `document.browsingTopics() `to return one or more topics, it must be called in
code from the same origin as code that was on a site where those topics were observed.

{% endAside %}

An API caller is said to have _observed_ a topic for a user if it has called the
`document.browsingTopics()` method in code included on a site that the Topics API has mapped to that
topic. For example:

1. The Topics API maps the hostname `knitting.example` to topics including "Fabric & Textile Arts".
1. Code from `adtech.example` is included in pages on `knitting.example`.
1. A user visits `knitting.example`.
1. The  `adtech.example` code calls  `document.browsingTopics(). `
1. One of the topics the browser has inferred for knitting.example is "Fabric & Textile Arts".
1. `adtech.example` is said to have observed the topic "Fabric & Textile Arts" for that user.

The API's `document.browsingTopics()` method will only provide topics that have already been
observed by the caller within the most recent three [epochs](#epoch). This helps stop information
about the user from being shared with more entities than technologies the API is replacing
(including third-party cookies).

The number of topics returned by `document.browsingTopics()` depends on the number of topics that
the [API caller](#caller) has previously observed, and the number of topics that the user has
available (such as the number of weeks of data accumulated). Anywhere from zero to three topics may
be returned.

### What might the Topics JavaScript API look like?

The code below provides a basic example of possible API usage (to keep it simple, there's no error
handling).

{% Aside 'warning' %}

This snippet of code is provided only to show what a Topics JavaScript API might look like. API
design is subject to change, and this code won't work in any browser right now!

{% endAside %}


```javascript
// Get the array of top topics for this user.
const topics = await document.browsingTopics();

// Request an ad creative.
const response = await fetch('https://ads.example/get-creative', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(topics)
})

// Get the JSON from the response.
const creative = await response.json();

// Display ad.
```

### How does the Topics API decide which callers can see which topic?

API callers only receive topics they've recently observed, and the topics for a user are refreshed
once each epoch. That means the API provides a rolling window in which a given caller may receive
certain topics.
The table below outlines an example (though unrealistically small) of a hypothetical browsing
history for a user during a single epoch, showing topics associated with the sites they've visited,
and the API [callers](#caller) present on each site (the entities that call
`document.browsingTopics()` in JavaScript code included on the site).

<table>
  <thead>
  <tr>
  <th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Site</strong></th>
  <th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Topics</strong></th>
  <th style="text-align: left;"><strong>API callers on site</strong></th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td>yoga.example</td>
    <td>Fitness</td>
    <td>adtech1.example adtech2.example</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>knitting.example</td>
    <td>Crafts</td>
    <td>adtech1.example</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>hiking-holiday.example</td>
    <td>Fitness, Travel & Transportation</td>
    <td>adtech2.example</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>diy-clothing.example</td>
    <td>Crafts, Fashion & Style</td>
    <td>[none]</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

At the end of the epoch (currently proposed to be one week) the Topics API generates the browser's
top topics for the week.

-  adtech1.example is now eligible to receive the "Fitness" and "Crafts" topics, since it
   observed them on yoga.example and also on knitting.example.
-  adtech1.example is not eligible to receive the "Travel & Transportation" topic for this user as it is not
   present on any sites the user visited recently that are associated with that topic.
-  adtech2.example has seen the "Fitness" and "Travel & Transportation" topics, but has not seen the "Crafts" topic.

The user visited diy-clothing.example, which has the "Fashion & Style" topic, but there were no calls to the
Topics API on that site. At this point, this means the "Fashion & Style" topic would not be returned by the
API for any caller.

In week two, the user visits another site:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
    <th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Site</strong></th>
    <th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Topics</strong></th>
    <th style="text-align: left;"><strong>API callers on site</strong></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td>sewing.example</td>
    <td>Crafts</td>
    <td>adtech2.example</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

In addition, code from adtech2.example is added to diy-clothing.example:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
    <th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Site</strong></th>
    <th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Topics</strong></th>
    <th style="text-align: left;"><strong>API callers on site</strong></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td>diy-clothing.example</td>
    <td>Crafts, Fashion & Style</td>
    <td>adtech2.example</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

As well as "Fitness" and "Travel & Transportation" from week 1, this means that adtech2.example will now be able to
receive the "Crafts" and "Fashion & Style" topic — but not until the following epoch, week 3. This ensures
that third parties can't learn more about a user's past (in this case, an interest in fashion) than
they could with cookies.

After another two weeks, "Fitness" and "Travel & Transportation" may drop out of adtech2.example's list of eligible
topics, if the user doesn't visit any sites with those topics that include code from
adtech2.example.

### How does the API infer topics for a site?

The Topics API explainer proposes that topics are derived from a [classifier
model](https://github.com/jkarlin/topics#:~:text=classifier) that maps website
[hostnames](https://web.dev/same-site-same-origin/#origin) to zero or more topics.
Analyzing additional information (such as full URLs or page contents) might enable more relevant
ads, but might also reduce privacy.
The classifier model for mapping hostnames to topics would be publicly available, and the explainer
proposes that it should be possible to view the topics for a site via browser developer tools. The
mapping model would be updated periodically; the frequency of this is still under consideration.

### How are the user's top five topics selected?

The API returns one topic for each epoch, up to a maximum of three. If three are returned, this
includes topics for the current epoch and the previous two.

1. At the end of each epoch, the browser compiles a list of pages that meet the following
   criteria:
   - The page was visited by the user during the epoch.
   - The page includes code that calls `document.browsingTopics()`
   - The API was enabled (for example, not blocked by the user or via a [response
      header](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Feature-Policy)).

1. The browser, on the user's device, uses the classifier model provided by the Topics API to map
   the hostname for each page to a list of topics.
1. The browser accumulates the list of topics.
1. The browser generates a list of the top five topics by frequency.

The  `document.browsingTopics()` method then returns a random topic from the top five  for each
epoch, with a 5% chance that any of these may be randomly chosen from the full taxonomy of topics.
In Chrome, users would also be able to remove individual topics, or clear their browsing history to
reduce the number of topics returned by the API. Users may also opt-out of the API: see [User
opt-out](#opt-out).

## How does the Topics API address concerns with FLoC?

The origin trial of [FLoC](https://github.com/WICG/floc) in 2021 received a wide range of feedback
from adtech and web ecosystem contributors. In particular, there were concerns that FLoC cohorts
could be used as a fingerprinting surface to identify users, or could reveal a user's association
with a sensitive category. There were also calls to make FLoC more transparent and understandable to
users.

The Topics API has been designed with this feedback in mind, to explore other ways to support
interest-based advertising, with improved transparency, stronger privacy assurances and a different
approach for sensitive categories.

### Reduce fingerprinting

The Topics API proposes multiple mechanisms to help ensure that it is difficult to reidentify
significant numbers of users across sites using the Topics API alone:

-  The Topics taxonomy provides a set of coarse-grained topics (the first taxonomy has around
   350 in total) which means that each topic is likely to have large numbers of users (depending on
   the total number of users the given browser has). In fact, there is a guaranteed minimum number
   of users per topic, because 5% of the time the returned topic is random.
-  Topics are returned at random from the user's top five.
-  5% of the time, a random topic (chosen from the full set of topics) is provided.
-  If a user frequently visits the same site (every week, for example) code running on the site
   can only learn at most one new topic per week.
-  Different sites will receive distinct topics for the same user in the same epoch. There is
   only a one-in-five chance that the topic returned for a user on one site matches the topic
   returned for them on another. This makes it more difficult to determine if they're the same user.
-  Topics are updated for a user once each week, which limits the rate at which information can
   be shared.
-  A topic will only be returned for an API caller that [previously observed the same
   topic](#observed-topics) for the same user recently. This model helps limit the potential for
   entities to learn about (or share) information about user interests they have not observed
   firsthand.

{: #sensitive-topics}

### Sensitive topics

The Topics [taxonomy](https://github.com/jkarlin/topics/blob/main/taxonomy_v1.md) will be public and
human-curated to avoid sensitive categories.

In addition, both sites and users can [opt out](#opt-out) of the Topics API.

{% Aside %}

As [the Topics proposal explainer describes](https://github.com/jkarlin/topics#meeting-the-privacy-goals):
"Third party cookies can be used to track anything about a user, from the exact URLs they visited,
 to the precise page content on those pages. This could include limitless sensitive material. The
 Topics API, on the other hand, is restricted to a human-curated taxonomy of topics. That's not to
 say that other things couldn't be statistically correlated with the topics in that taxonomy. That
 is possible. But when comparing the two, Topics seems like a clear improvement over cookies."

{% endAside %}

### User controls and transparency

Users should be able to understand the purpose of the Topics API, recognize what is being said about
them, know when the API is in use, and be provided with controls to enable or disable it.

The API's human-readable taxonomy enables people to learn about and control the topics that may be
suggested for them by their browser. Users can remove topics they specifically do not want the Topics 
API to share with advertisers or publishers, and there can be UX for informing the user about the API 
and how to enable or disable it. Chrome would provide information and settings for the Topics API at
chrome://settings/privacySandbox. In addition, topics are not available to API callers in Incognito
mode, and topics are cleared when browsing history is cleared.

{: #opt-out}

### Site opt-out

Only sites that include code which calls the Topics API would be included in the browsing history
eligible for topic frequency calculations, and API callers [only receive topics they've
observed](#observed-topics). In other words, sites are not eligible for topic frequency calculations
without the site or an embedded service taking action to call the API.

The Topics explainer also proposes sites be allowed to block topic calculation for their visitors
via the following
[Permissions-Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Feature-Policy)
header:

```text
Permissions-Policy: browsing-topics=()
```

{% Aside %}

The existing Permissions-Policy `interest-cohort=()` from FLOC will also forbid topic calculation.

{% endAside %}

### User opt-out

The Topics API explainer [proposes](https://github.com/jkarlin/topics#:~:text=empty) that the list
of topics returned will be empty if:

-  The user opts out of the Topics API via browser settings at chrome://settings/privacySandbox.
-  The user has cleared their topics (via the browser settings at
   chrome://settings/privacySandbox) or [cleared their
   cookies](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/32050).
-  The browser is in Incognito mode.

The explainer provides [more detail about privacy
goals](https://github.com/jkarlin/topics#meeting-the-privacy-goals) and how the API seeks to address
them.
