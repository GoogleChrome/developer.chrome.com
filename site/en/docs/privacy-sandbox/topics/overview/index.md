## What is the Topics API?

The Topics API is a [Privacy Sandbox](/docs/privacy-sandbox/overview/) mechanism designed to preserve privacy while allowing a browser to share information with third parties about a user's interests. It enables interest-based advertising (IBA) without having to resort to tracking the sites a user visits. 
Interest-based advertising is a key concept in understanding the Topics API.
IBA is a form of personalized advertising in which an ad is selected for a user based on their interests, inferred from the sites they've recently visited. This is different from contextual advertising, which aims to match ads to the content on the page the user is visiting.
