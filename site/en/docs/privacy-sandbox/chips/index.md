## Changes

- **June 2022**:  Based on feedback, setting cookies with the `Partitioned` attribute no longer requires omitting the `Domain` attribute. This allows subdomains of a third-party site to access cookies within a partition.

## Implementation status

## What is CHIPS

Cookies Having Independent Partitioned State (CHIPS) allows developers to opt a cookie into partitioned storage, with separate cookie jars per top-level site, improving user privacy and security.

Browsers are well under way in phasing out unpartitioned third-party cookies, so CHIPS and [Related Website Sets](/docs/privacy-sandbox/related-website-sets/) ([formerly called First-Party Sets](/blog/related-website-sets/)) will be the only way to read and write cookies from cross-site contexts, such as iframes, when third-party cookies are blocked.

Without partitioning, third-party cookies can enable services to track users and join their information from across many unrelated top-level sites. This is known as cross-site tracking.

   alt="Without cookie partitioning, a third-party service can set a cookie when embedded in one top-level site and access that same cookie when the service is embedded in other top-level sites.",
   width="800", height="450"
%}

CHIPS introduces a new cookie attribute, `Partitioned`, to support cross-site cookies that are partitioned by top-level context.

Set-Cookie header:

```text
Set-Cookie: __Host-name=value; Secure; Path=/; SameSite=None; Partitioned;
```

Javascript:

```js
Document.cookie="__Host-name=value; Secure; Path=/; SameSite=None; Partitioned;"
```

A partitioned third-party cookie is tied to the top-level site where it's initially set and cannot be accessed from elsewhere. This way cookies set by a third-party service can only be read within the same embedded context of the top-level site where they were initially set.

{% Img src="image/vgdbNJBYHma2o62ZqYmcnkq3j0o1/PODInBIXZrgGeUoFhipj.png", alt="With cookie partitioning, a third-party service that sets a cookie when embedded in one top-level site cannot access that same cookie when the service is embedded in other top-level sites.", width="800", height="443" %}

With partitioned cookies, when a user visits site A and embedded content from site C sets a cookie with the Partitioned attribute, the cookie is saved in a partitioned jar designated only for cookies that the site C sets when it's embedded on site A. The browser will only send that cookie when the top-level site is A.

When the user visits a new site, for example site B, an embedded C frame will not receive the cookie that was set when C was embedded in site A.

If a user visits site C as a top level website, the partitioned cookie that C set when it was embedded in A will not be sent in that request either.

{% Img src="image/vgdbNJBYHma2o62ZqYmcnkq3j0o1/FaQYaZyTsAxCm8GvvVc8.png", alt="With cookie partitioning, a third-party service that sets a cookie when embedded in a site cannot access that same cookie even when the users visits the service as top-level site.", width="400", height="304" %}

## Use cases

For example, the site `retail.example` may want to work with a third-party service `support.chat.example` to embed a support chat box on its site. Many embeddable chat services today rely on cookies to save interaction history.

{% Img src="image/vgdbNJBYHma2o62ZqYmcnkq3j0o1/jsxgCpkMRXwXughPjg7j.png", alt="Top-level site retail.example embedding a third-party service support.chat.example.", width="400", height="310" %}

Without the ability to set a cross-site cookie, `support.chat.example` could instead rely on `retail.example` passing along their first-party session identifier (or some derived value of it). In that case, every website that `support.chat.example` is embedded on would require additional setup to pass along the state.

Alternatively, `support.chat.example` may request `retail.example` to embed JavaScript that's hosted on `support.chat.example` on `retail.example` pages. This introduces security risks, because it allows the `support.chat.example` script to have elevated privileges on `retail.example`, such as the ability to access authentication cookies.

Example use cases for CHIPS include any scenarios where cross-site subresources require some notion of session or persistent state that is scoped to a user's activity on a single top-level site, such as:

+   Third-party chat embeds
+   Third-party map embeds
+   Third-party payment embeds
+   Subresource CDN load balancing
+   Headless CMS providers
+   Sandbox domains for serving untrusted user content (such as googleusercontent.com and githubusercontent.com)
+   Third-party CDNs that use cookies to serve content that's access-controlled by the authentication status on the first-party site (for example, profile pictures on social media sites hosted on third-party CDNs)
+   Front-end frameworks that rely on remote APIs using cookies on their requests
+   Embedded ads that need state scoped per publisher (for example, capturing users' ads preferences for that website)


## Why it's important to opt into cookie partitioning

As browsers are phasing out unpartitioned third-party cookies, a couple of other approaches to partitioning have been attempted.

Firefox announced that they are [partitioning all third-party cookies by default](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2021/02/introducing-state-partitioning/) in their ETP Strict mode and private browsing mode, so all cross-site cookies are partitioned by the top-level site. However, partitioning cookies without a third-party opt-in can lead to unexpected bugs, since some third-party services have built servers which expect an unpartitioned third-party cookie.

[Safari previously tried partitioning cookies based on heuristics](https://webkit.org/blog/8613/intelligent-tracking-prevention-2-1/), but eventually chose to block them altogether, citing developer confusion as one of the reasons. Recently, [Safari expressed interest in an opt-in based model](https://github.com/privacycg/storage-access/issues/75).

What sets CHIPS apart from existing implementations of partitioned cookies is the third-party opt-in. Cookies must be set with a new attribute in order to be sent on cross-party requests once (unpartitioned) third-party cookies are obsoleted.

While third-party cookies still exist, the `Partitioned` attribute provides an opt-in to a more restrictive, more secure type of cookie behavior. CHIPS is an important step to help services make a smooth transition to a future without third-party cookies.

## CHIPS design details

### Partitioning model

Today, cookies are keyed on the hostname or domain of the site that set them, that is, their _host key_.

For example, for cookies from `https://support.chat.example`, the host key is `("support.chat.example")`.

Under CHIPS, cookies that opt into partitioning will be double-keyed on their host key and _partition key_.

A _cookie's partition key_ is the site ([scheme and registrable domain](https://web.dev/articles/same-site-same-origin#%22schemeful_same_site%22)) of the top-level URL the browser was visiting at the start of the request to the endpoint that set the cookie.

In the example above where `https://support.chat.example` is embedded on `https://retail.example`, the top-level URL is `https://retail.example`.

The partition key in that case is `("https", "retail.example")`.

Likewise, a _request's partition key_ is the site of the top-level URL the browser is visiting at the start of a request. Browsers must only send a cookie with the `Partitioned` attribute in requests with the same partition key as that cookie.

Here's what the cookie key in the example above looks like before and after CHIPS.

   alt="Site A and the embedded site C share a partitioned cookie. When not embedded, site C cannot access the partitioned cookie.",
   width="800", height="204"
%}


**Before CHIPS**

```text
key=("support.chat.example")
```

**After CHIPS**

```text
key={("https", "retail.example"),
     ("support.chat.example")}
```

{% Aside %}
Chrome has a limit of maximum 180 cookies per partition that cannot exceed 10 KB per-embedded-site.
{% endAside %}

#### Related Website Sets and cookie partitioning

[Related Website Sets (RWS)](/docs/privacy-sandbox/related-website-sets-integration/) is a web platform mechanism for developers to declare relationships among sites, so that browsers can use this information to enable limited cross-site cookie access for specific, user-facing purposes. Chrome will use these declared relationships to decide when to allow or deny a site access to their cookies when in a third-party context.

The current Related Website Sets design relies on Storage Access API and does not integrate with CHIPS partitioning.

Consider Related Website Sets in situations where you need the same cookie to be available to a service that's embedded in multiple related sites.

CHIPS provides the functionality for a service to act as an isolated component across multiple sites. If the service that's a member of a Related Website Set sets a partitioned cookie, its partition key will be the top-level site and that cookie will not be available to other set members.

If you have a use case that relies on a shared cookie partition across sites within a FPS you can [provide examples and feedback on the GitHub issue](https://github.com/WICG/first-party-sets/issues/94).


### Security design

To encourage good security practices, with CHIPS, cookies are only set by and sent over secure protocols.

Partitioned cookies must be set with `Secure`.

It is recommended to use the `__Host` prefix when setting partitioned cookies to make them bound to the hostname (and not the registrable domain).

Example:

```text
Set-Cookie: __Host-example=34d8g; SameSite=None; Secure; Path=/; Partitioned;
```

{% Aside %}
Adding `SameSite=None` will allow your cookie to be sent in third-party contexts where the `Partitioned` attribute is not supported, as long as third-party cookies are allowed in browser settings.
{% endAside %}

## Demo

This demo will walk you through how partitioned cookies work and how you can inspect them in DevTools.

Site A embeds an iframe from Site B which uses JavaScript to set two cookies: a partitioned and unpartitioned cookie. Site B displays all cookies accessible from that location using [`document.cookie`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Document/cookie).

When third-party cookies are blocked, site B will only be able to set and access the cookie with the `Partitioned` attribute in cross-site context.

When third-party cookies are allowed, site B is able to also set and access the unpartitioned cookie.

  <figcaption>Left: Third-party cookies are blocked. Right: Third-party cookies are allowed.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Prerequisites

1.  Chrome 114 or higher.
1.  Ensure third-party cookies are blocked:
    -   Open **Settings > Privacy and security**.
    -   Click **Third party cookies**.
    -   Select **Block third party cookies**.

### Use DevTools to inspect partitioned cookies

1.  Visit [https://chips-site-A.glitch.me](https://CHIPS-site-A.glitch.me).
1.  Press `Control+Shift+J` (or `Command+Option+J` on Mac) to open DevTools.
1.  Click the **Application** tab.
1.  Navigate to **Application > Storage > Cookies**.
1.  Click on `https://chips-site-B.glitch.me`.

DevTools will display all the cookies from the selected origin.

<figure>

  <figcaption>Cookies from site B in the DevTools Application tab.</figcaption>
</figure>

Site B can only set the partitioned cookie in cross-site context, the unpartitioned cookie will be blocked:

-   You should see `__Host-partitioned-cookie` with the partition key of the top level site `https://chips-site-A.glitch.me`.

<figure>
{% Img src="image/vgdbNJBYHma2o62ZqYmcnkq3j0o1/DvSAMie7T41SFBY7wUrc.png", alt="", width="800", height="52" %}
  <figcaption>Partition key for __Host-partitioned-cookie.</figcaption>
</figure>


{% Aside %}
This view shows all cookies for that partition and any unparitioned cookies, even if they are not accessible in the current page. If you visit site B as a top level site, you would see the unpartitioned cookie here, but it would not be available to site B when it's embedded on site A.
{% endAside %}

1.  Click **Go to Site B**.
1.  In DevTools, navigate to **Application > Storage > Cookies**.
1.  Click on `https://chips-site-B.glitch.me`.

<figure>
{% Img src="image/vgdbNJBYHma2o62ZqYmcnkq3j0o1/WXqkkGCjROCcDSEKXew5.png", alt="Site B", width="400", height="1129" %}
</figure>

In this scenario, because you are on site B in top-level context, it can set and access both cookies:

-   `unpartitioned-cookie` has an empty partition key.
-   `__Host-partitioned-cookie` cookie has the partition key `https://chips-site-B.glitch.me`.

<figure>
{% Img src="image/vgdbNJBYHma2o62ZqYmcnkq3j0o1/vl4ouXXVqQ1bB5dEP4iK.png", alt="", width="800", height="245" %}
  <figcaption>Cookies from site B in the DevTools Application tab when visiting B as a top-level site. __Host-partitioned-cookie has the partition key https://chips-site-B.glitch.me.</figcaption>
</figure>

If you navigate back to site A, `unpartitioned-cookie` is now stored in the browser, but it will not be accessible from site A.

1.  Click **Go to Site A**.
1.  Click the **Network** tab.
1.  Click on `https://chips-site-B.glitch.me`.
1.  Click on the **Cookies** tab.

While on site A, you should see the `__Host-partitioned-cookie` with the partition key of the top level site `https://chips-site-A.glitch.me`.

  <figcaption>Network tab showing cookies from site B iframe that are accessible when it's embedded on site A.</figcaption>
</figure>

If you check **show filtered out cookies requests** DevTools will show that the unpartitioned cookie is blocked, highlighted in yellow with a tooltip: _"This cookie was blocked due to user preferences"_.

<figure>

  <figcaption>Network tab showing blocked cookies from site B iframe.</figcaption>
</figure>

{% Aside %}
Because you visited B as a top-level site, site B also has a partitioned cookie with the partition key `https://chips-site-B.glitch.me` that's not available to it in this context so you will see a message: _"This site has cookies in another partition that were not sent with this request"._
{% endAside %}

In **Application > Storage > Cookies** clicking on `https://chips-site-B.glitch.me`
will show:

-   `unpartitioned-cookie` with the empty partition key.
-   `__Host-partitioned-cookie` cookie with the partition key `https://chips-site-A.glitch.me`.

<figure>
{% Img src="image/vgdbNJBYHma2o62ZqYmcnkq3j0o1/tv3pAAoTktiX3nZdIUIh.png", alt="", width="800", height="257" %}
