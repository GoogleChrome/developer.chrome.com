Deploy and manage an Aggregation Service to process aggregatable
reports from the
[Attribution Reporting API](/docs/privacy-sandbox/attribution-reporting/) or
the [Private Aggregation API](/docs/privacy-sandbox/private-aggregation/) to
create a [summary report](/docs/privacy-sandbox/summary-report/).

## Implementation status

* The [Aggregation Service](https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/blob/main/AGGREGATION_SERVICE_TEE.md)
  has [now moved to general availability](/blog/privacy-sandbox-launch/).
* The [Aggregation Service can be tested](#test) with the
  Attribution Reporting API and the Private Aggegration API for Protected Audience API and Shared Storage.

The explainer outlines
[key terms](https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/blob/main/AGGREGATION_SERVICE_TEE.md#key-terms),
useful for understanding the Aggregation Service.

### Availability

{% Partial 'privacy-sandbox/timeline/aggregation-service.njk' %}

## Secure data processing

The Aggregation Service decrypts and combines the collected data from the aggregatable reports, [adds noise](#noise-scale), and returns the final summary report. This service runs in a trusted execution environment (TEE), which is deployed on a cloud service that supports necessary security measures to protect this data.

{% Aside %}
A [Trusted Execution Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_execution_environment)
is a special configuration of computer hardware and software that allows
external parties to verify the exact versions of software running on the
computer. TEEs allow external parties to verify that the software does exactly
what the software manufacturer claims it doesâ€”nothing more or less.
{% endAside %}

The TEE's code is the only place in the Aggregation Service which has access to
raw reports&mdash;this code will be auditable by security researchers, privacy
advocates, and ad techs. To confirm that the TEE is running the exact approved
software and that data remains secured, a coordinator performs attestation.

### Coordinator attestation of the TEE {: #coordinator }

The _coordinator_ is an entity responsible for key management and aggregatable
report accounting.

A coordinator has several responsibilities: 

* Maintain a list of authorized binary images. These images are
  [cryptographic hashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function)
  of the Aggregation Service software builds, which Google will periodically
  release. This will be reproducible so that any party can verify the images
  are identical to the Aggregation Service builds.
* Operate a key management system. Encryption keys are required for the Chrome
  on a user's device to encrypt aggregatable reports. Decryption keys are
  necessary for proving the Aggregation Service code matches the binary images.
* Track the aggregatable reports to prevent reuse in aggregation for summary
  reports, as reuse may reveal personal identifying information (PII).

If you are testing the Aggregation Service, see the [Coordinator Service
Additional Terms of Service](/docs/privacy-sandbox/aggregation-service/tos/).
{% endAside %}

### "No duplicates" rule {: #no-duplicates-rule }

To gain insight into the contents of a specific aggregatable report, an
attacker might make multiple copies of the report and include those copies in a
single or multiple batches. Because of this, the Aggregation Service enforces a
"no duplicates" rule:

* **In a batch**: An aggregatable report can only appear once within a batch.
* **Across batches**: Aggregatable reports cannot appear in more than one batch or contribute to more than one summary report.

To accomplish this, the browser assigns each aggregatable report a shared ID.
The browser generates the shared ID from several data points, including: API
version, reporting origin, destination site, source registration time, and
scheduled report time. This data comes from the
[`shared_info`](https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/blob/main/AGGREGATE.md#aggregatable-reports) field in the report.

The Aggregation Service confirms that all aggregatable reports with the same
shared ID are in the same batch and reports to the coordinator that the shared
ID was processed. If multiple batches are created with the same ID, only one
batch can be accepted for aggregation, and other batches are rejected. 

When you perform a [debug run](https://github.com/privacysandbox/aggregation-service/blob/main/docs/DEBUGGING.md),
the "no duplicates" rule is not enforced across batches.  In other words,
reports from previous batches may appear in a debug run. However, the rule is
still enforced within a batch. This allows you to experiment with the service
and various batching strategies, without limiting future processing in a
production environment.

## Noise and scaling {: #noise-scale}

To protect user privacy, the Aggregation Service applies an
[additive noise mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_noise_mechanisms)
to the raw data from aggregatable reports. This means that a certain amount of
statistical noise is added to each aggregate value before its release in a
summary report. 

While you are not in direct control of the ways noise is added, you can
influence the impact of noise on its measurement data.

<figure>

  alt="Noise is constant, regardless of the aggregated value.",
  width="600", height="462"
%}
</figure>

The noise value is randomly drawn from a
[Laplace probability distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_distribution),
and the distribution is the same regardless of the amount of data collected in
aggregatable reports. The more data you collect, the less impact the noise will
have on the summary report results. You can multiply the aggregatable report
data by a scaling factor to reduce the impact of noise.

To understand how noise is added, your controls, and the impact on your
reports, refer to the
[Contribution budget](/docs/privacy-sandbox/attribution-reporting/contribution-budget/) and [Scale up to contribution budget](/docs/privacy-sandbox/attribution-reporting/working-with-noise/#scale-up-to-contribution-budget) in [Working with noise](/docs/privacy-sandbox/attribution-reporting/working-with-noise/).

## Generate summary reports

Summary report generation is dependent on your API usage. Learn more about
generating summary reports for the
[Private Aggregation API](/docs/privacy-sandbox/private-aggregation/) 
and the [Attribution Reporting API](/docs/privacy-sandbox/attribution-reporting/).

## Test the Aggregation Service {: #test}

We recommend reading the corresponding experiment and participate guide for the API you're testing:

* [Attribution Reporting API](/docs/privacy-sandbox/attribution-reporting-experiment/)
* [Private Aggregation API](/docs/privacy-sandbox/private-aggregation-experiment/)

To test the Aggregation Service on AWS, see [these instructions](https://github.com/privacysandbox/aggregation-service/blob/main/README.md#test-on-aws-with-support-for-encrypted-reports). 

A [local testing tool](https://github.com/privacysandbox/aggregation-service/blob/main/README.md) is also available to process aggregatable reports for Attribution Reporting and the Private Aggregation API.

## Engage and share feedback

The Aggregation Service is a key piece of the Privacy Sandbox measurement APIs. Like other Privacy Sandbox APIs, this is documented and discussed publicly on GitHub.
  
* **Github**: Read the [explainer](https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/blob/main/AGGREGATION_SERVICE_TEE.md), [raise questions and participate in the discussion](https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/issues). Also take a look at the [Aggregation Service implementation](https://github.com/privacysandbox/aggregation-service) and provide [feedback on the implementation](https://github.com/privacysandbox/aggregation-service/issues).
* **Developer support**: Ask questions and join discussions on the [Privacy Sandbox Developer Support repo](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/privacy-sandbox-dev-support).
