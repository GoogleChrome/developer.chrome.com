To use the Coordinator Service, including related reports, features and
functionality (collectively the "**Coordinator Service**"), you and the legal
entity on whose behalf you are using the Coordinator Service (if any) (together,
"**You**") must accept (1) [the Google Terms of
Service](https://policies.google.com/terms), and (2) these Coordinator Service
Additional Terms of Service (the "**Additional Terms**").

Please read each of these documents carefully. Together, these documents are
known as the "**Terms**". They establish what you can expect from us as you use
the Coordinator Service, and what we expect from you.

If these Additional Terms conflict with [the Google Terms of
Service](https://policies.google.com/terms), these Additional Terms will apply. 

## Purpose of Coordinator Service

The Coordinator Service is designed to ensure that reports from the client
software, such as a Chrome browser or an Android device, which are sent to the
Aggregation Service, will run on Approved Aggregation Service Code and Binaries
and to configure access to decryption keys and manage aggregatable report
accounting.

## Definitions

"Aggregation Service"
: means a service operated by You using Approved Aggregation Service Code and
Binaries that processes data from aggregatable reports to create a summary
report and is intended to prevent inappropriate access to raw attributed
conversion data or other intermediate data.

"Approved Aggregation Service Code and Binaries"
: means the open source code or compiled binaries approved by Google that You
will run in the Cloud Serviceâ€™s Trusted Execution Environment to operate the
Aggregation Service and use the Coordinator Service.

"Cloud Service"
: is a cloud service(s) that (i) is capable of supporting the needed security
features of a Trusted Execution Environment and (ii) is included in the list of
supported Cloud Service providers, which may be updated at any time by Google.

"Coordinator"
: is one or more entities responsible for key management and aggregatable report
accounting used in connection with the Aggregation Service. The Coordinator(s)
will maintain a list of hashes of Approved Aggregation Service Code and Binaries
and configure access to decryption keys.

"Trusted Execution Environment" (or "TEE")
: means a dedicated, closed execution context that is isolated through hardware
memory protection and cryptographic protection of storage and where the TEE's
contents are protected from observation and tampering by unauthorized parties,
including the root user.

## What we expect from you

You are responsible for using the Coordinator Service in accordance with these
Terms. That means, in addition to following [the Google Terms of

   information you give to Google will always be accurate and up to date and
   you'll inform Google promptly of any updates. You provide permission to share
   your registration information with Coordinator(s).

   ensure you are always using up to date Approved Aggregation Service Code and
   Binaries as made available

   the Coordinator Service.

Additionally, when using the Coordinator Service, you will not (nor allow those
