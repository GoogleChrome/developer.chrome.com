## Implementation status

This document outlines a new HTML element: `<fencedframe>`.

{% Partial 'privacy-sandbox/timeline/fenced-frames.njk' %}

{% Partial 'privacy-sandbox/timeline/fenced-frames-features.njk' %}

## Why do we need fenced frames?

A fenced frame (`<fencedframe>`) is an HTML element for embedded
content, similar to an iframe. Unlike iframes, a fenced frame restricts
communication with its embedding context to allow the frame access to cross-site
data without sharing it with the embedding context. Some Privacy Sandbox APIs
may [require select documents to render within a fenced frame](#use-cases).

Similarly, any first-party data in the embedding context cannot be shared with
the fenced frame.

For example, let's say `news.example` (the embedding context) embeds an ad from
`shoes.example` in a fenced frame. `news.example` cannot exfiltrate data from
the `shoes.example` ad, and `shoes.example` cannot learn first-party data from
`news.example`.

### Strengthen cross-site privacy with storage partitioning

While browsing the web, you've probably looked at products on one site, and then
you've seen them appear again in an ad on a completely different site.

Today, this advertising technique is achieved primarily through tracking
technology that uses third-party cookies to share information across sites. This
is technology which [Chrome has committed to phase
out](https://blog.google/products/chrome/updated-timeline-privacy-sandbox-milestones/)
and replace with more privacy-preserving variants.

Chrome is working on [storage
partitioning](https://github.com/privacycg/storage-partitioning), which
separates browser storage per-site. Currently, if an iframe from `shoes.example`
is embedded on `news.example`, and that iframe stores a value into storage,
then that value can be read from the `shoes.example` site. When storage has been
partitioned, cross-site iframes will no longer share storage, therefore
`shoes.example` will not be able to access information stored by the iframe. If
the iframe is served from `*.shoes.example` and embedded on
`*.shoes.example`, browser storage will be shared as these are considered [same-site](https://web.dev/articles/same-site-same-origin).

{% Img src="image/hVf1flv5Jdag8OQKYqOcJgWUvtz1/ss7wjBshEJcwdQXcXGov.png", alt="A comparison of before and after state of storage partitinoing.", width="800", height="613" %}

Storage partitioning will be applied to standard storage APIs including
LocalStorage, IndexedDB, and cookies. In a partitioned world, information
leakage across first-party storage will be significantly reduced.

### Work with cross-site data {: #cross-site-data }

Fenced frames is a [Privacy Sandbox feature](/docs/privacy-sandbox/overview/)
which suggests top-level sites should partition data. Many Privacy Sandbox
proposals and APIs aim to satisfy cross-site use cases without third-party cookies or
other tracking mechanisms. For example:

*  [Protected Audience API](/docs/privacy-sandbox/protected-audience/) allows for interest-based ad serving
   in a privacy-preserving manner.
*  [Shared Storage](https://github.com/pythagoraskitty/shared-storage) allows
   access to unpartitioned cross-site data in a secure environment.

Let's consider how fenced frames could work with the
[Protected Audience API](/docs/privacy-sandbox/protected-audience/). With the Protected Audience API, a user's interests
are registered on an advertiser's site in [interest
groups](/docs/privacy-sandbox/protected-audience/#interest-group-detail), along with ads that
may be of interest to the user. Then, on a separate site (known as a
"publisher"), the ads registered in relevant interest groups are auctioned and
the winning ad is displayed in a fenced frame.

If the publisher displays the winning ad in an iframe and the script can read the
iframe's `src` attribute, the publisher can infer information about the visitor's
interests from that ad's URL. This is not privacy-preserving.

With a fenced frame, the publisher could display an ad which matches visitor
interests, but the `src` and interest group will be known only to the advertiser
in the frame. The publisher could not access this information.

## How do fenced frames work?

Fenced frames use the `FencedFrameConfig` object for navigation. This object can be returned from a Protected Audience API auction or Shared Storage’s URL selection operation. Then, the config object is set as the `config` attribute on the fenced frame element. This differs from an iframe where a URL or opaque [URN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Name) is assigned to the `src` attribute. The `FencedFrameConfig` object has a read-only `url` property; however, since the current use-cases require the actual URL of the internal resource to be hidden, this property returns the string `opaque` when read.

A fenced frame can't use `postMessage` to communicate with its embedder. However, a fenced frame can use `postMessage` with iframes inside the fenced frame.

Fenced frames will be isolated from the publisher in other ways. For instance
the publisher won't have access to the DOM inside of a fenced frame, and the
fenced frame cannot access the publisher's DOM. Further, attributes such as
`name`&mdash;which can be set to any value to and observed by the
publisher&mdash;aren't available in fenced frames.

Fenced frames behave like a [top-level browsing
context](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#top-level-browsing-context)
(such as a browser tab). Although a fenced frame in [certain use cases](https://github.com/WICG/fenced-frame/blob/master/explainer/use_cases.md)
(such as `opaque-ads`) can contain cross-site data (such as a Protected Audience API interest
group), the frame cannot access unpartitioned storage or cookies. An
`opaque-ads` fenced frame can access a unique, nonce-based cookie and storage
partition.

The characteristics of fenced frames are further detailed in the
[explainer](https://github.com/shivanigithub/fenced-frame/blob/master/explainer/README.md).

### How do fenced frames compare to iframes? {: #compare }

Now that you know what fenced frames will and won't do, it's useful to compare
to existing iframe features.


<table class="with-heading-tint">
     <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Feature </th>
      <th><code>iframe</code></th>
      <th><code>fencedframe</code></th>
    </tr></thead>
      <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Embed content</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Embedded content can access embedding context DOM</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>No</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Embedding context can access embedded content DOM</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>No</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Observable attributes, such as <code>name</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>No</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>URLs (<code>http://example.com</code>) </td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>Yes (<a href="https://github.com/WICG/fenced-frame/blob/master/explainer/use_cases.md">dependent on use case</a>)</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Browser-managed opaque source (<code>urn:uuid</code>)</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Access to cross-site data </td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>Yes (dependent on use case)</td>
   </tr>
</tbody></table>


Fenced frames support fewer external communication options to preserve privacy.

### Will fenced frames replace iframes?

Ultimately, fenced frames won't replace iframes and you won't have to use them.
Fenced frames are a more private frame for usage when data from
different top-level partitions needs to be displayed on the same page.

Same-site iframes (sometimes known as friendly iframes) are considered trusted
content.

## Use fenced frames {: #use-cases }

Fenced frames will work in combination with other Privacy Sandbox APIs to
display documents from different storage partitions within a single page.
Potential APIs are currently in discussion.

Current candidates for this combination include:

* From the [TURTLEDOVE API](https://github.com/WICG/turtledove) family (which is
   the basis for the Protected Audience API), fenced frames could work with [Conversion Lift
   Measurement](https://github.com/w3c/web-advertising/blob/main/support_for_advertising_use_cases.md#conversion-lift-measurement)
   using [Shared Storage](https://github.com/pythagoraskitty/shared-storage).
* Another option is to allow fenced frames to be
   [read-only](https://github.com/WICG/fenced-frame/blob/master/explainer/use_cases.md#read-only)
   or [access unpartitioned
   storage](https://github.com/WICG/fenced-frame/blob/master/explainer/use_cases.md#unpartitioned-storage).


For more details, refer to the [Fenced Frames
use cases explainer](https://github.com/WICG/fenced-frame/blob/master/explainer/use_cases.md).

### Examples

To obtain a fenced frame `config` object, you must pass in `resolveToConfig: true` to Protected Audience API’s `runAdAuction()` call or Shared Storage’s `selectURL()` call. If the property is not added (or is set to `false`), the resulting promise will resolve to a URN that can only be used in an iframe.

{% Compare 'better', 'Get fenced frame config from Protected Audience API auction' %}
```js
const frameConfig = await navigator.runAdAuction({
  // ...auction configuration
  resolveToConfig: true
});
```
{% endCompare %}

{% Compare 'better', 'Get fenced frame config from Shared Storage URL Selection' %}
```js
const frameConfig = await sharedStorage.selectURL('operation-name', {
  resolveToConfig: true
});
```
{% endCompare %}

Once you have obtained the config, you can assign it to a fenced frame's `config` attribute to navigate the frame to the resource represented by the config. Older versions of Chrome don’t support the `resolveToConfig` property, so you must still confirm that the promise resolved to a `FencedFrameConfig` before navigating:

{% Compare 'better', 'Set config to the fenced frame attribute' %}
```js
if (window.FencedFrameConfig && frameConfig instanceof FencedFrameConfig) {
  const frame = document.createElement('fencedframe');
  frame.config = frameConfig;
}
```
{% endCompare %}

To learn more, see the [Fenced Frame](https://github.com/WICG/fenced-frame/tree/master/explainer) and [Fenced Frame config](https://github.com/WICG/fenced-frame/blob/master/explainer/fenced_frame_config.md) explainers.

### Headers

Browsers will set `Sec-Fetch-Dest: fencedframe` for requests made from fenced frames and iframes that are embedded within a fenced frame.

```text
Sec-Fetch-Dest: fencedframe
```

The server must set the `Supports-Loading-Mode: fenced-frame` response header for a document to be loaded in a fenced frame. The header must be present for any iframes inside of a fenced frame, as well.

```text
Supports-Loading-Mode: fenced-frame
```

### Shared Storage context

You may want to use Private Aggregation to report event-level data in fenced frames associated with contextual data from the embedder. By using the `fencedFrameConfig.setSharedStorageContext()` method, you can pass some contextual data, such as an event ID, from the embedder to shared storage worklets initiated by the Protected Audience API.

In the following example, we store some data available on the embedder page and some data available in the fenced frame in shared storage. From the embedder page, a mock event ID is set as the shared storage context. From the fenced frame, the frame event data is passed in.

From the embedder page, you can set contextual data as the shared storage context:

```js
const frameConfig = await navigator.runAdAuction({ resolveToConfig: true });

// Data from the embedder that you want to pass to the shared storage worklet
frameConfig.setSharedStorageContext('some-event-id');

const frame = document.createElement('fencedframe');
frame.config = frameConfig;
```

From the fenced frame, you can pass in event-level data from the frame into the shared storage worklet (unrelated to the contextual data from the embedder above):

```js
const frameData = {
  // Data available only inside the fenced frame
}

await window.sharedStorage.worklet.addModule('reporting-worklet.js');

await window.sharedStorage.run('send-report', {
  data: {
    frameData
  },
});
```

You can read the embedder’s contextual information from `sharedStorage.context` and the frame’s event-level data from the `data` object, then report them through Private Aggregation:

```js
class ReportingOperation {
  convertEventIdToBucket(eventId) { ... }
  convertEventPayloadToValue(info) { ... }

  async run(data) {
    // Data from the embedder
    const eventId = sharedStorage.context;

    // Data from the fenced frame
    const eventPayload = data.frameData;

    privateAggregation.sendHistogramReport({
      bucket: convertEventIdToBucket(eventId),
      value: convertEventPayloadToValue(eventPayload)
    });
  }
}

register('send-report', ReportingOperation);
```

To learn more about the embedder’s context in a fenced frame config object, see the [explainer](https://github.com/WICG/fenced-frame/blob/master/explainer/fenced_frame_config_context.md).

## Try fenced frames

[Use Chrome
flags](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/run-chromium-with-flags) to
enable the Fenced Frame API at `chrome://flags/#enable-fenced-frames`.

{% Img
   src="image/PV7xjXdOKHP8LWt9XhstsToJeK82/AeU7fj1b3I9dfnqkDc6h.png",
   alt="In Chrome Experiments, set Enabled for the flag named Enable the Fenced frame element",
   width="800",
   height="211"
%}

There are multiple choices in the dialog. We strongly recommend you select
****Enable****, which allows Chrome to automatically update to new architecture
as it becomes available.

The other options, **Enabled with ShadowDOM** and **Enabled with multiple
page architecture**, offer different implementation strategies which are only
relevant to browser engineers. Today, **Enable** works in the same way as
**Enabled with ShadowDOM**. In the future, **Enable** will map to **Enable with
multiple page architecture**.

### Feature detection

To determine if fenced frames are defined:

```js
if (window.HTMLFencedFrameElement) {
  // The fenced frame element is defined
}
```

To determine if the fenced frame config is available:
```js
if (window.FencedFrameConfig && frameConfig instanceof FencedFrameConfig) {
   // The fenced frame config is available
}
```

### Browser support

The `<fencedframe>` element is still in experimental mode, so it is currently
supported from Chrome 97 onwards. At this time, it's [not supported by other
browsers](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5699388062040064#consensus).
