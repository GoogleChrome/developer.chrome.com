## Learn the essentials

Read [Attribution Reporting](/docs/privacy-sandbox/attribution-reporting/) and
check the most recent [updates](/docs/privacy-sandbox/attribution-reporting-updates/).

## Try the API

1. Try the [demo](https://goo.gle/attribution-reporting-demo/).
2. Check the [API status](/docs/privacy-sandbox/attribution-reporting/#status) to learn about ways
   you can experiment with the API today.
3. Experiment with the API.
   * (Optional) If you ran an origin trial with this API in 2021, follow the [migration
     guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NY7SScCYcPc9v5wtf_fVAikFxGQTAFvwldhExN1P03Y/edit#)
     to participate in the latest origin trial.
   * To experiment with the API, follow these guides:
     * [What you should know about the Attribution Reporting
       API](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lvrKd5Vv7SYLMGZb0Fz7bpGNEl0LOx9i1waAHw2sUg8/)
     * [Handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BXchEk-UMgcr2fpjfXrQ3D8VhTR-COGYS1cwK_nyLfg/):
       Demo, detailed code examples and (local) debugging tips.
4. Experiment with [summary
   reports](/docs/privacy-sandbox/summary-reports).
   *  Adtechs can generate summary reports with the [aggregation service](/docs/privacy-sandbox/aggregation-service). Set up
      [local testing](https://github.com/google/trusted-execution-aggregation-service/#set-up-local-testing)
      or [test in production with Amazon Web Services](https://github.com/google/trusted-execution-aggregation-service/#test-on-aws-with-support-for-encrypted-reports) (AWS) :
        *  Create or have an [AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) available.
        *  [Register](/origintrials/#/view_trial/771241436187197441) for the
	      Privacy Sandbox Relevance and Measurement origin trial (OT).
        *  Complete the aggregation service
	      [onboarding form](https://forms.gle/EHoecersGKhpcLPNA). After you've
		submitted this form, we'll send a verification email and instructions.
   *  Refer to the [strategy and tips for summary reports](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bU0a_njpDcRd9vDR0AJjwJjrf3Or8vAzyfuK8JZDEfo/edit?usp=sharing).
