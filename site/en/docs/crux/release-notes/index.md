The CrUX dataset on BigQuery is updated on the second Tuesday of every month. Each release is numbered according to the year and calendar month of the data collection period, for example 201912 corresponds to the UX data collected during December 2019 and would be released on the second Tuesday of January 2020 after the data collection period has ended.

In the list below, we've curated some release notes for each monthly dataset. Subscribe to our [CrUX Announce](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!forum/chrome-ux-report-announce) mailing list or follow [@ChromeUXReport](https://twitter.com/ChromeUXReport) on Twitter for release Announcements.

## 202206

[Announcement](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/chrome-ux-report-announce/c/_DiKAAqqKPE)

Publication date
 : July 13, 2022

What's new
 : - The number of origins covered by the CrUX dataset increases once again in this release due to the optional dimensions feature introduced in the previous release. We expect the size to be much more stable from here. Please see the [announcement](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/chrome-ux-report-announce/c/_DiKAAqqKPE) as well.

Notable stats
 : - 16,230,572 origins
 : - 41.3% of origins have good [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/#core-web-vitals)

## 202205

[Announcement](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/chrome-ux-report-announce/c/A_LAY_lYxQk)

Publication date
 : June 14, 2022

What's new
 : - The percentage of origins having good LCP experiences increased this month by 2.4%, thanks in large part to an improvement in the [performance of Chrome on Android](https://blog.chromium.org/2022/03/a-new-speed-milestone-for-chrome.html#:~:text=Chrome%20continues%20to%20get%20faster%20on%20Android%20as%20well.%20Loading%20a%20page%20now%20takes%2015%25%20less%20time%2C%20thanks%20to%20prioritizing%20critical%20navigation%20moments%20on%20the%20browser%20user%20interface%20thread.). This was a major contributing factor to the percentage of origins having good Core Web Vitals increasing by 2.1%.
 : - With this release, CrUX records no longer require effective connection type and form factor, so we're including data for which these fields are `NULL`, indicating all effective connection types or form factors, respectively. This allows us to increase origin coverage by 28.2%.
 : - An unrelated issue with our data pipeline prevents us from adding new origins in this release, so we're only including origins for which we published data in the previous 6 months. Due to this, `experimental.popularity.rank` has some gaps, e.g. there are only 904 origins in the top 1,000. This is unique to the 202205 release and should be fixed next month.

Notable stats
 : - 11,024,795 origins
 : - 42% of origins have good Core Web Vitals

## 202102

[Announcement](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/chrome-ux-report-announce/c/fyUSl0--9Z8)

Publication date
 : March 9, 2021

What's new
 : - Coarse origin ranking data will be available in the CrUX dataset on BigQuery, starting in the February 2021 (202102) release. With this feature, we'll be able to unlock new insights into the aggregate user experiences of the head, torso, and tail of the web. All origins in the global and per-country tables will be assigned rank magnitude values under the experimental namespace, experimental.popularity.rank. Values will be powers of 10, starting with the top 1,000, then 10,000, 100,000, and so on. For example, a rank magnitude of 10,000 means that an origin is among the top 10,000 most visited origins in the dataset ([learn more](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2021/03/crux-rank-magnitude)).
 : - Tell us what you think of this new feature. We welcome your feedback on the [CrUX discussion forum](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/chrome-ux-report).

What's new
 : - As of December 3, PageSpeed Insights (web and API) is [sourcing its field data from the CrUX API](https://groups.google.com/g/pagespeed-insights-discuss/c/by9-TbqdlBM/m/Ovgg_o22AAAJ), bringing the tools closer in alignment.
 : - We rolled out a small [accuracy improvement](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/chrome-ux-report-announce/c/vOlMzdG-uGo) to metrics' 75th percentiles in the CrUX API.
 : - The API results were [frozen](https://twitter.com/ChromeUXReport/status/1332746842254217217) for a few days at the end of November and the issue has since been fixed.

## 202008

[Announcement](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/chrome-ux-report-announce/c/vXXUE6qslKU/m/O6tjPcUtBAAJ)

Publication date
 : September 9, 2020

What's new
 : - There was a bump in origin coverage this month (+3.3%) due in part to a data pipeline change. Previously, for a user experience record to be included in the dataset, it must have included FP, DCL, and OL measurements. Now, the only required metric is FCP. This change helps to ensure that we're capturing more meaningful user experiences.

Publication date
 : July 14, 2020

What's new
 : - User experiences served from Google's AMP cache are now attributed to the publisher's origin in CrUX. Effects will vary depending on the amount of AMP cache traffic relative to the rest of the website, but most origins see less than a 5 percentage point change in Core Web Vitals performance, with most effects being positive.

What's new
 : - There were two [LCP updates](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/speed/metrics_changelog/2020_05_lcp.md), which should have a minimal effect on most origins

What's new
 : - There was a [small improvement](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/speed/metrics_changelog/2020_04_lcp.md) to the way LCP is measured in M81. This may manifest itself in your CrUX data as a slight shift in slower LCP or in rare cases too few LCP samples to include for your origin.
 : - Introducing [Web Vitals](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/introducing-web-vitals-essential-metrics.html)! CrUX is committed to providing you with all of your Core Web Vital metrics to give you an accurate picture of how real users experience the web.
 : - Do you query data on a per-country basis? Give the new [`experimental.country`](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=chrome-ux-report&d=experimental&t=country&page=table) table a try! It's optimized to make querying across country and monthly datasets super easy.
