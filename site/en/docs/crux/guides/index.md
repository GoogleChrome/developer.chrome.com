As well as the formal technical specifications, we have the following guides available to learn how to use the Chrome User Experience Report:

- [Using the Chrome UX Report on BigQuery](/blog/chrome-ux-report-bigquery/)
- [Building a CrUX Dashboard on Looker Studio](/blog/chrome-ux-report-looker-studio-dashboard/)
- [Using the Chrome UX Report API](/blog/chrome-ux-report-api/)
- [Using the Chrome UX Report History API](/blog/chrome-ux-report-history-api/)
- [Using the Chrome UX Report on PageSpeed Insights](/blog/chrome-ux-report-pagespeed-insights/)

These provide a step by step introduction to using these various interfaces to CrUX to complement the technical documentation.
