{% Aside %}

The [Chrome Privacy Whitepaper][1] gives background detail regarding the features which this API can
control.

{% endAside %}

## Manifest

You must declare the "privacy" permission in your extension's [manifest][2] to use the API. For
example:

```json
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "privacy"
  ],
  ...
}
```

## Usage

Reading the current value of a Chrome setting is straightforward. You'll first need to find the
property you're interested in, then you'll call `get()` on that object in order to retrieve its
current value and your extension's level of control. For example, to determine if Chrome's Autofill
feature is enabled, you'd write:

```js
chrome.privacy.services.autofillEnabled.get({}, function(details) {
  if (details.value) {
    console.log('Autofill is on!');
  } else {
    console.log('Autofill is off!');
  }
});
```

Changing the value of a setting is a little bit more complex, simply because you first must verify
that your extension can control the setting. The user won't see any change to their settings if your
extension toggles a setting that is either locked to a specific value by enterprise policies
(`levelOfControl` will be set to "not_controllable"), or if another extension is controlling the
value (`levelOfControl` will be set to "controlled_by_other_extensions"). The `set()` call will
succeed, but the setting will be immediately overridden. As this might be confusing, it is advisable
to warn the user when the settings they've chosen aren't practically applied.

Full details about extensions' ability to control `ChromeSetting`s can be found under
[`chrome.types.ChromeSetting`][3].

{% endAside %}

This means that you ought to use the `get()` method to determine your level of access, and then only
call `set()` if your extension can grab control over the setting (in fact if your extension can't
control the setting it's probably a good idea to visually disable the functionality to reduce user
confusion):

```js
chrome.privacy.services.autofillEnabled.get({}, function(details) {
  if (details.levelOfControl === 'controllable_by_this_extension') {
    chrome.privacy.services.autofillEnabled.set({ value: true }, function() {
      if (chrome.runtime.lastError === undefined) {
        console.log("Hooray, it worked!");
      } else {
        console.log("Sadness!", chrome.runtime.lastError);
      }
    });
  }
});
```

If you're interested in changes to a setting's value, add a listener to its `onChange` event. Among
other uses, this will allow you to warn the user if a more recently installed extension grabs
control of a setting, or if enterprise policy overrides your control. To listen for changes to
Autofill's status, for example, the following code would suffice:

```js
chrome.privacy.services.autofillEnabled.onChange.addListener(
  function (details) {
    // The new value is stored in `details.value`, the new level of control
    // in `details.levelOfControl`, and `details.incognitoSpecific` will be
    // `true` if the value is specific to Incognito mode.
  }
);
```
