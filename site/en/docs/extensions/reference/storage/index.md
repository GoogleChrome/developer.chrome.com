## Overview {: #overview }

The Storage API provides an extension-specific way to persist user data and state. It's similar to the web platform's storage APIs ([IndexedDB][mdn-indexeddb], and [localStorage][mdn-localstorage]), but was designed to meet the storage needs of extensions. The following are a few key features: 

- All extension contexts, including the extension service worker and content scripts have access to the Storage API.
- The JSON serializable values are stored as object properties.
- The Storage API is asynchronous with bulk read and write operations.
- Even if the user clears the cache and browsing history, the data persists.
- Stored settings persist even when using [split incognito][incognito].
- Includes an exclusive read-only [managed storage area][manifest-storage] for enterprise policies.

{% Details %}
{% DetailsSummary %}
ðŸ’¡ Can extensions use the WebStorage API?
{% endDetailsSummary %}

Even though extensions can access [`Window.localStorage`][mdn-localstorage] in some contexts (popup and other HTML pages), it is not recommended for the following reasons:

- The extension's service worker cannot access `Window.localStorage`.
- Content scripts share the `Window.localStorage` of the host page.
- Data saved to `Window.localStorage` is lost when the user clears their browsing history.

{% endDetails %}

### Storage areas

The Storage API is divided into the following four buckets ("storage areas"): 

[`storage.local`][prop-local]
: Data is stored locally, which is cleared when the extension is removed. The quota limitation is approx 5 MB, but can be increased by requesting the `"unlimitedStorage"` permission. Consider using it to store larger amounts of data.

[`storage.sync`][prop-sync]
: If syncing is enabled, the data is synced to any Chrome browser that the user is logged into. If disabled, it behaves like `storage.local`. When the browser is offline, Chrome stores the data locally and resumes syncing when it's back online. The quota limitation is 100 KB approx, 8 KB per item. Consider using it to preserve user settings across synced browsers. 


{% Aside 'warning' %}

Local and sync storage areas should not store confidential user data because they are not encrypted. When working with sensitive data, consider using the `session` storage area to hold values in memory until the browser is shut down.

{% endAside %}

[storage.session][prop-session]
: Holds data in memory for the duration of a browser session. By default, it's not exposed to content scripts, but this behavior can be changed by setting [`chrome.storage.session.setAccessLevel()`][method-access-level]. The quota limitation is approximately 10 MB. Consider using it to store global variables across service worker runs.

{% Aside 'warning' %}

Before Chrome 112, the quota was approximately 1 MB.

{% endAside %}

[storage.managed][prop-managed]
: Administrator can use a [schema][manifest-storage] and enterprise policies to configure a supporting extension's settings in a managed environment. This storage area is read-only.

## Manifest {: #manifest}

To use the storage API, declare the `"storage"` permission in the extension
[manifest][doc-manifest]. For example:

```json
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "storage"
  ],
  ...
}
```

## Usage {: #usage }

The following samples demonstrate the `local`, `sync`, and
`session` storage areas:

<web-tabs>
  <web-tab title="storage.local">

  ```js
  chrome.storage.local.set({ key: value }).then(() => {
    console.log("Value is set to " + value);
  });

  chrome.storage.local.get(["key"]).then((result) => {
    console.log("Value currently is " + result.key);
  });
  ```

  </web-tab>
  <web-tab title="storage.sync">

  ```js
  chrome.storage.sync.set({ key: value }).then(() => {
    console.log("Value is set to " + value);
  });

  chrome.storage.sync.get(["key"]).then((result) => {
    console.log("Value currently is " + result.key);
  });
  ```

  </web-tab>
  <web-tab title="storage.session">

  ```js
  chrome.storage.session.set({ key: value }).then(() => {
    console.log("Value is set to " + value);
  });

  chrome.storage.session.get(["key"]).then((result) => {
    console.log("Value currently is " + result.key);
  });
  ```

  </web-tab>
</web-tabs>

## Storage and throttling limits {: #storage-and-throttling-limits}

Don't think of adding to the Storage API as putting things in a big truck. Think of adding to
storage as being like putting something in a pipe. The pipe may have material in it already, and it
may even be filled. Always assume a delay between when you add to storage and when it is actually
recorded.

For details on storage area limitations and what happens when they are exceeded, see the quota information for [`sync`][prop-sync], [`local`][prop-local], and [`session`][prop-session].

## Use cases {: #examples}

The following sections demonstrate common use cases for the Storage API.

### Synchronous response to storage updates

To track changes made to storage, you can add a listener to its `onChanged` event. When anything changes in storage, that event fires. The sample code listens for these changes:


{% Label %}background.js:{% endLabel %}

```js
chrome.storage.onChanged.addListener((changes, namespace) => {
  for (let [key, { oldValue, newValue }] of Object.entries(changes)) {
    console.log(
      `Storage key "${key}" in namespace "${namespace}" changed.`,
      `Old value was "${oldValue}", new value is "${newValue}".`
    );
  }
});
```

We can take this idea even further. In this example, we have an [options page][options-page] that
allows the user to toggle a "debug mode" (implementation not shown here).  The options page immediately saves the new settings to `storage.sync`, and the service worker uses `storage.onChanged` to apply the setting as soon as possible.

{% Label %}options.html:{% endLabel %}

```html
<!-- type="module" allows you to use top level await -->
<script defer src="options.js" type="module"></script>
<form id="optionsForm">
  <label for="debug">
    <input type="checkbox" name="debug" id="debug">
    Enable debug mode
  </label>
</form>
```

{% Label %}options.js:{% endLabel %}

```js
// In-page cache of the user's options
const options = {};
const optionsForm = document.getElementById("optionsForm");

// Immediately persist options changes
optionsForm.debug.addEventListener("change", (event) => {
  options.debug = event.target.checked;
  chrome.storage.sync.set({ options });
});

// Initialize the form with the user's option settings
const data = await chrome.storage.sync.get("options");
Object.assign(options, data.options);
optionsForm.debug.checked = Boolean(options.debug);
```

{% Label %}background.js:{% endLabel %}

```js
function setDebugMode() { /* ... */ }

// Watch for changes to the user's options & apply them
chrome.storage.onChanged.addListener((changes, area) => {
  if (area === 'sync' && changes.options?.newValue) {
    const debugMode = Boolean(changes.options.newValue.debug);
    console.log('enable debug mode?', debugMode);
    setDebugMode(debugMode);
  }
});
```

### Asynchronous preload from storage {: #asynchronous-preload-from-storage}

Since service workers are not always running, Manifest V3 extensions sometimes need to
asynchronously load data from storage before they execute their event handlers. To do this, the
following snippet uses an async `action.onClicked` event handler that waits for the `storageCache`
global to be populated before executing its logic.

{% Label %}background.js:{% endLabel %}

```js
// Where we will expose all the data we retrieve from storage.sync.
const storageCache = { count: 0 };
// Asynchronously retrieve data from storage.sync, then cache it.
const initStorageCache = chrome.storage.sync.get().then((items) => {
  // Copy the data retrieved from storage into storageCache.
  Object.assign(storageCache, items);
});

chrome.action.onClicked.addListener(async (tab) => {
  try {
    await initStorageCache;
  } catch (e) {
    // Handle error that occurred during storage initialization.
  }

  // Normal action handler logic.
  storageCache.count++;
  storageCache.lastTabId = tab.id;
  chrome.storage.sync.set(storageCache);
});
```
