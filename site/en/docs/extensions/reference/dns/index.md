### Usage {: #usage }

The following code calls [`resolve()`](#method-resolve) to retrieve the IP address of `example.com`.

{% Label %}service-worker.js:{% endLabel %}

```js
const resolveDNS = async () => {
    let record = await chrome.dns.resolve('example.com');
    console.log(record.address); // "192.0.2.172"
};

resolveDNS();
```

{% Aside 'important' %}
Do not include the scheme or trailing slash in the hostname. For example, `https://example.com/` is invalid.
