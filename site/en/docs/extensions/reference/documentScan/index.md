## Document Scan API

The Document Scan API is designed to allow apps and extensions to view the
content of paper documents on an attached document scanner.

**Note:** This API depends on OS features that may not be available depending
on the underlying operating system. As of this writing only Chrome OS for
certain USB-attached devices is known to successfully work.
