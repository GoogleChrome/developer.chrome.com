## Manifest

You must declare the "fileSystemProvider" permission and section in the [extension manifest](/extensions/manifest) to use the File System Provider API. For example:

```json
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "fileSystemProvider"
  ],
  ...
  "file_system_provider_capabilities": {
    "configurable": true,
    "watchable": false,
    "multiple_mounts": true,
    "source": "network"
  },
  ...
}
```

The file_system_provider section must be declared as follows:

**`configurable` (boolean)** - optional

: Whether configuring via onConfigureRequested is supported. By default: false.

**`multiple_mounts` (boolean)** - optional

: Whether multiple (more than one) mounted file systems are supported. By default: false.

**`watchable` (boolean)** - optional

: Whether setting watchers and notifying about changes is supported. By default: false.

**`source` (enum of "file", "device", or "network")** - required

: Source of data for mounted file systems.

Files app uses above information in order to render related UI elements appropriately. For example, if `configurable` is set to true, then a menu item for configuring volumes will be rendered. Similarly, if `multiple_mounts` is set to `true`, then Files app will allow to add more than one mount points from the UI. If `watchable` is `false`, then a refresh button will be rendered. Note, that if possible you should add support for watchers, so changes on the file system can be reflected immediately and automatically.

## Overview

File System Provider API allows extensions to support virtual file systems, which are available in the file manager on ChromeOS. Use cases include decompressing archives and accessing files in a cloud service other than Drive.

## Mounting file systems

Providing extensions can either provide file system contents from an external source (such as a remote server or a USB device), or using a local file (such as an archive) as its input.

In order to write file systems which are file handlers (source is `"file"`) the provider must be a packaged app, as the `onLaunched` event is not available to extensions.

If the source is network or a device, then the file system should be mounted when [onMountRequested](#event-onMountRequested) event is called.

| [Source](#manifest-source) of the file system data | Entry point |
|----------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `"file"` | Available to packaged apps only. |
| `"device"` or `"network"` | [onMountRequested](#event-onMountRequested) |

## Configuring file systems

Provided file systems once mounted can be configured via the [onConfigureRequested](#event-onConfigureRequested) event. It's especially useful for file systems which provide contents via network in order to set proper credentials. Handling this event is optional.

## Life cycle

Provided file systems once mounted are remembered by Chrome and remounted automatically after reboot or restart. Hence, once a file system is [mounted](#method-mount) by a providing extension, it will stay until either the extension is unloaded, or the extension calls the [unmount](#method-unmount) method.
