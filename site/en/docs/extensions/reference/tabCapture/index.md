## Overview {: #overview }

The chrome.tabCapture API allows you to access a [MediaStream][media-stream] containing video and
audio of the current tab. It can only be called after the user invokes an extension, such as by
clicking the extension's [action button][action-button]. This is similar to the behavior of the
[activeTab][active-tab] permission.

## Preserving system audio {: #preserving-system-audio }

When a [MediaStream][media-stream] is obtained for a tab, audio in that tab will no longer be played
to the user. This is similar to the behavior of the [`getDisplayMedia()`][get-display-media] function when
the [`suppressLocalAudioPlayback`][supress-playback] flag is set to true.

To continue playing audio to the user, use the following:

```js
const output = new AudioContext();
const source = output.createMediaStreamSource(stream);
source.connect(output.destination);
```

This creates a new `AudioContext` and connects the audio of the tab's `MediaStream` to the default
destination.

## Stream IDs {: #stream-ids }

Calling [chrome.tabCapture.getMediaStreamId][get-media-stream-id] will return a stream ID. To later
access a [MediaStream][media-stream] from the ID, use the following:

```js
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
  audio: {
    mandatory: {
      chromeMediaSource: "tab",
      chromeMediaSourceId: id,
    },
  },
  video: {
    mandatory: {
      chromeMediaSource: "tab",
      chromeMediaSourceId: id,
    },
  },
});
```

### Usage restrictions {: #usage-restrictions }

After calling [`getMediaStreamId()`][get-media-stream-id], there are restrictions on where the
returned stream ID can be used:

- If `consumerTabId` is specified, the ID can be used by a `getUserMedia()` call in any frame in the
given tab which has the same security origin.
- When this is not specified, beginning in Chrome 116, the ID can be used in any frame with the
same security origin in the same render process as the caller. This means that a stream ID obtained
in a service worker can be used in an [offscreen document][offscreen-document].

Prior to Chrome 116, when a `consumerTabId` was not specified, the stream ID was restricted to both
the security origin, render process and render frame of the caller.

`tabCapture` and related APIs to solve a number of common use cases.
