We do our best to improve the content of this site and of the [Chrome Web Store help](/docs/webstore/). Some of you might run into problems we don't cover. Fortunately, there are other ways for you to get help.

## For extensions development

- Many members of the Chrome extensions team monitor and participate in the [Chromium extensions](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/chromium-extensions) Google Group.
- StackOverflow has a few tags you should follow and search. The [google-chrome-extension](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/google-chrome-extension) tag covers Chrome extensions generally. There's also a [chrome-extension-manifest-v3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/chrome-extension-manifest-v3) tag.

## For Chrome Web Store

Use our [One Stop Support](https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/contact/one_stop_support) page to get help with issues related to your Chrome Web Store account or items.
