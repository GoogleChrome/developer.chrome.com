### 2021.01.19: Manifest V3 launched

With the release of Chrome 88, the extensions platform now supports extensions
built with Manifest v3, and you can upload them to the Chrome Web Store.
Manifest v3 is a new extension platform that makes Chrome extensions more
secure, performant, and privacy respecting, by default.

Check out [Welcome to Manifest V3](/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/) for complete
details about Manifest V3 and how to build or migrate extensions for it.
