Many extension API methods support promises.  This document explains how to use promises when
calling these methods.

{% Aside "key-term" %}
A *promise* is a JavaScript object that represents the eventual outcome of an asynchronous
operation. For more about promises and their use, see the MDN documentation on
[using promises][mdn-promises].
{% endAside %}

## Introduction

Promises were introduced into Chrome not long after they were included in the ES6 specification.
They are an important feature of modern JavaScript, providing benefits such as:

* Streamlined error handling
* Coding in a synchronous style for invoking asynchronous functions
* A simple "fork and join" syntax for invoking concurrent functions

Extensions can use promises beginning with Manifest V3. Many API methods support promises, and we
are progressively adding promise support to additional API methods.

{% Aside 'gotchas' %}
Promises are not available for extensions using Manifest V2, and are not available on all API methods.
{% endAside  %}

Promises can and should be used in many circumstances. However, there are times (for example, event
listeners) when a promise won't work and a callback is more appropriate. Methods that support
promises also support callbacks to provide backwards compatibility.

## Can I use promises?

You can and should use promises in your extension code, where a promise is available and appropriate
to the use case.

Not all methods in extensions APIs support promises. Sometimes that's because we haven't added
promise support on the method yet; in many cases it's because using a promise isn't feasible for the
method.

You see if an API method support promises by checking its API reference page:
 
{% Img src="image/SHhb2PDKzXTggPGAYpv8JgR81pX2/AYQVtnh19vNMHoXzxZB1.png", alt="Screenshot showing a
method that supports promises", width="800", height="280" %}

The screenshot above shows a method from the [`chrome.tabs`][api-tabs-methods] API. You can see that
this method supports promises because one of the method's signatures returns a promise. To make this
easier to see at a glance, the reference docs also display a `Promise` pill below the signatures.

## How to use promises

There are many places where using promises will result in cleaner, easier-to-maintain code. You
should consider using promises in situations such as the following:

* Any time that you want to clean up your code by using a more "synchronous" invocation style.
* Where error handling would be too difficult using callbacks.
* When you want a simpler way to invoke a number of concurrent methods and gather the results into a single thread of code.

### Converting a callback to a promise {: #compare-to-callback}

One way to understand how you can use promises in extensions APIs is to compare two equivalent code
fragments, one using a callback and one using a promise. The following example shows this
comparison:

<!--
// --- Standard callback implementation ---
// --- Promise implementation ---
-->

#### Standard callback implementation

```js

function openTabOnRight(onComplete) {
  chrome.tabs.query(queryOptions, function(tabs) {
    if (chrome.runtime.lastError) {
      onComplete({error: chrome.runtime.lastError});
      return;
    }

    if (!tabs.length) {
      onComplete();
      return;
    };

    chrome.tabs.create({
      url: 'https://example.com',
      index: tab[0].index + 1,
    }, function(tab) {
      if (chrome.runtime.lastError) {
        onComplete({error: chrome.runtime.lastError});
      }

      console.log('tab created', tab);
      onComplete(tab);
    });
  });
}
```

#### Promise implementation

```js
function openTabOnRight() {
  // Errors are automatically propagated down the promise chain
  return chrome.tabs.query(queryOptions)
    .then((tabs) => {
      if (!tabs.length) return;

      return chrome.tabs.create({
        url: 'https://example.com',
        index: tab[0].index + 1,
      });
    })
    .then(tab => {
      if (!tab) return;

      console.log('tab created', tab);
      return tab;
    });
}
```


### Error handling

Returning errors works differently depending on whether the extension is using a callback or a
promise.

#### Error handling with callbacks

If using a callback, then `chrome.runtime.lastError` is set for the duration of the execution of the
callback. It is not thrown as a JS Error (which would interrupt JS execution), and is not set
outside the duration of the callback run (which would result in it being "randomly" set during other
execution).  The extension would look at the last error like this:

```js
chrome.tabs.create({...}, (result) => {
  if (chrome.runtime.lastError) {
    // Handle last error
  }
});
```

#### Error handling with promises

Promises are designed to deliver asynchronous results, both success and failure.  A failure in a
promise (a promise rejection) is handled differently.  It might look like this:

```js
chrome.tabs.create({...})
  .then((result) => {
    // success case
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // failure case
  });
```

Extensions APIs don't set `chrome.runtime.lastError` when you use a promise; instead they provide
the error as an argument to the function in the `.catch()`.

{% Aside %}
In simpler cases with a single promise, you can instead supply your error handler as the second
parameter to `.then()` instead of chaining to a `.catch()`. For more about this topic, see this [MDN
article on chained promises][mdn-promise-chain].
{% endAside %}

Whether you receive the error using `.catch()` or the optional second parameter of `.then()`,
this form of error handling helps you write async logic in a more synchronous style.

### Using async/await

JavaScript also provides async/await as syntactic sugar on top of promises, letting you code in a more
imperative style. The following example shows how to implement the [example shown
earlier](#compare-to-callback) using async/await:

```js
// Async/await implementation

async function openTabOnRight() {
  // When not wrapped in try/catch, errors thrown in an async
  // function will propagate down the promise chain
  let tabs = await chrome.tabs.query(queryOptions);

  if (!tabs.length) return;
  let tab = await chrome.tabs.create({
    url: 'https://example.com',
    index: tab[0].index + 1,
  });

  if (!tab) return;
  console.log('tab created', tab);
  return tab;
}
```

{% Aside %}
Note that `await` is only valid in async functions and the top-level bodies of modules.
