This site introduces Manifest V3 for Chrome Extensions (Manifest V3). It presents the
background and reasons for introducing Manifest V3 and our vision for the platform's
future, along with guidance on how to optimize your extensions to use Manifest V3.

Manifest V3 represents one of the biggest shifts in the extensions platform
since it launched a decade ago. Extensions using Manifest V3 will enjoy enhancements in
security, privacy, and performance; they can also use more contemporary Open
Web technologies adopted in Manifest V3, such as service workers and promises.
Developers can update their extensions today to take advantage of these Manifest V3
features; this will become mandatory as we phase out Manifest V2 in the future.

Manifest V3 is part of a shift in the philosophy behind how we approach
end-user security and privacy. The pages in this section provide an overview of
Manifest V3, the reasons behind it, and how to approach it:


* [Platform vision](platform-vision) explains how the Manifest V3 changes fit into the big picture of where the platform is going.
* [Overview of Manifest V3](mv3-overview) summarizes the technical changes introduced with Manifest V3.
* [Migration guide](mv3-migration) tells you how to get started updating Manifest V2 extensions so they work in Manifest V3.

We're excited about the improvements that Manifest V3 brings to the extensions
platform. Look for further announcements on the [Chromium
Blog](https://blog.chromium.org/) and the [Chromium Extensions
forum](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/chromium-extensions).
