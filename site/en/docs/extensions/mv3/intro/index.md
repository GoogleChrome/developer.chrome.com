This site introduces Manifest V3 for Chrome Extensions.

Manifest V3 represents one of the most significant shifts in the extensions platform since it
launched a decade ago. Manifest V3 extensions will enjoy enhancements in security, privacy, and
performance; they can also use more contemporary Open Web technologies such as service workers and
promises. 

The pages in this section provide an overview of Manifest V3, the reasons behind it, and how to
approach it:

- [Platform vision][mv3-platform] explains how the Manifest V3 changes fit into the big picture of where the platform is going.
- [Overview of Manifest V3][mv3-overview] summarizes the technical changes introduced with Manifest V3.
- [Migration guide][mv3-migration] tells you how to get started updating Manifest V2 extensions so they work in Manifest V3.

Developers must begin to migrate their extensions to Manifest V3; this will become mandatory as we [phase out Manifest V2][mv2-sunset] in 2023.

We're excited about the improvements that Manifest V3 brings to the extensions
platform. Look for further announcements on the [Chromium
Blog][chromium-blog] and [What's new in Chrome Extensions][doc-new].
