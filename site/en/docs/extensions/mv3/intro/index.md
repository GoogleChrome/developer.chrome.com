This site introduces Manifest V3 for Chrome Extensions (Manifest V3). It presents the background and
reasons for introducing Manifest V3 and our vision for the platform's future, along with guidance on
how to optimize your extensions to use Manifest V3.

Manifest V3 represents one of the biggest shifts in the extensions platform since it launched a
decade ago. Extensions using Manifest V3 will enjoy enhancements in security, privacy, and
performance; they can also use more contemporary Open Web technologies adopted in Manifest V3, such
as service workers and promises. Developers can update their extensions today to take advantage of
these Manifest V3 features; this will become mandatory as we phase out Manifest V2 in the future.

Manifest V3 is part of a shift in the philosophy behind how we approach end-user security and
privacy. The pages in this section provide an overview of Manifest V3, the reasons behind it, and
how to approach it:


* [Platform vision][vision] explains how the Manifest V3 changes fit into the big picture of where
  the platform is going.
* [Overview of Manifest V3][overview] summarizes the technical changes introduced with Manifest V3.
* [Migration guide][migration] tells you how to get started updating Manifest V2 extensions so they
  work in Manifest V3.
* [Known issues][known-issues] outlines major bugs and extension platform capabilities that are in
  development.

We're excited about the improvements that Manifest V3 brings to the extensions platform. Look for
further announcements on the [Chromium Blog](https://blog.chromium.org/) and the [Chromium
Extensions forum](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/chromium-extensions).
