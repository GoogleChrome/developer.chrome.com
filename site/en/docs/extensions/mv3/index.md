These pages contain guides and reference information for developers who want to
create extensions for the Chrome browser.

If you're not sure where to begin, have a look at the following starting pages:

- [Extensions 101][doc-ext-101] covers some basic concepts of extension development.
- [Development Basics][doc-dev-basics] introduces the extension development workflow.

Beyond that, you might find useful entry points in these pages:

- Choose one of the step-by-step [getting started tutorials][gs-tuts].
- Learn the scope of things in the [Extension development overview][doc-dev-overview].
- Pick something from the [samples page][gh-ext-samples], install it, and start hacking on it.

{% Aside 'warning' %}

As Manifest V3 approaches full feature parity with V2, we will be phasing out
Manifest V2 in 2023. See [Manifest V2 support timeline][doc-mv2-sunset] for details.

In addition to the documentation here, many developers find helpful community content at:

- The [Chromium extensions][gg-extensions] Google Group.
- The Stack Overflow [google-chrome extension][so-extension-tag] tag.

Thank you for being a member of the extension developer community. We're glad you are here!
