These pages contain guides and reference information for developers who want to
create extensions for the Chrome browser. If you're not sure where to begin,
have a look at the following starting pages:

* [What are extensions?](/docs/extensions/mv3/overview/) to help you understand just what an extension is.
* The [Getting started tutorial](/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/) if you're ready for hello, world.

Beyond that, you might find useful entry points in these pages:

* Learn the scope of things in the [Extension development overview](/docs/extensions/mv3/devguide/)
* Pick something from the [samples page](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples), install it, and start hacking on it.
* Look for answers in the [Extensions FAQ page](/docs/extensions/mv3/faq/)

{% Aside %}
Now that Manifest V3 has launched, we've changed the default documentation to
be for Manifest V3. If you are maintaining a legacy Manifest V2 extension, see the [Manifest V2
documentation](/docs/extensions/mv2).
{% endAside %}

{% Aside 'warning' %}
As Manifest V3 approaches full feature parity with V2, we will be phasing out
Manifest V2. See [Manifest V2 support timeline](/docs/extensions/mv3/mv2-sunset) for details.
{% endAside %}

In addition to the documentation here, many developers find helpful community content at:

* The [Chromium extensions](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/chromium-extensions) Google Group.
* The Stack Overflow [google-chrome extension](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/google-chrome-extension/info) tag.

Thank you for being a member of the extension developer community. We're glad you are here!
