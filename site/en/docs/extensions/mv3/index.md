Google Chrome Extensions are applications that run inside the Chrome browser and provide additional
functionality, integration with third party websites or services, and customized browsing
experiences. These pages contain guides and reference information for developers who want to
create extensions for the Chrome browser.

If you're not sure where to begin, have a look at the following starting pages:

- [Extensions 101][doc-ext-101] covers some basic concepts of extension development.
- [Development Basics][doc-dev-basics] introduces the extension development workflow.

Beyond that, you might find useful entry points in these pages:

- Choose one of the step-by-step [getting started tutorials][gs-tuts].
- Learn the scope of things in the [Extension development overview][doc-dev-overview].
- Pick something from the [samples page][gh-ext-samples], install it, and start hacking on it.

Additionally, keep up with Chrome extensions news by visiting our [What's new page][doc-whats-new]. If you need assistance with a development problem, visit our [help page][doc-get-help]
