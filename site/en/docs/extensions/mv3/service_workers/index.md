description: How to respond to browser triggers (events) from a Chrome Extension service worker.
---

Extensions are event-based programs used to modify or enhance the Chrome browsing experience. Events
are browser triggers, such as navigating to a new page, removing a bookmark, or closing a tab.
Extensions monitor these events using scripts in an [extension service
worker][doc-sw-migration] (previously called a background script), which then executes specified instructions.

An extension service worker is loaded when it is needed, and unloaded when it goes dormant.
Examples include:

- The extension is first installed or updated to a new version.
- An extension event is dispatched.
- A content script or other extension [sends a message][1].

Once it has been loaded, an extension service worker generally runs as long as it is
actively receiving events. The browser will stop the service worker once it idles for
a short period (30 seconds).

{% Aside %}

Opening a view doesn't cause the service worker to load, but only prevents it from closing once
loaded.

{% endAside %}

Extension service workers stay dormant until an event they are listening for fires. At which point, they execute the appropriate event listener, idle, then unload.

## Register the service worker {: #manifest }

Extensions register their service worker in the [manifest][3] under the `"background"`
field. This field uses the `"service_worker"` key, which specifies a single JavaScript file.

```json/3-6
{
  "name": "Awesome Test Extension",
  ...
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "background.js"
  },
  ...
}
```

You can optionally specify an extra field of `"type": "module"` to include the service worker as an
ES Module, which allows you to `import` further code. See [ES modules in service workers][sw-module]
for more information. For example:

```json/2-2
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "background.js",
    "type": "module"
  }
```

## Initialize the extension {: #initialization }

Listen to the [`runtime.onInstalled`][6] event to initialize an extension on installation. Use this
event to set a state or for one-time initialization, such as a [context menu][7].

```js
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(() => {
  chrome.contextMenus.create({
    "id": "sampleContextMenu",
    "title": "Sample Context Menu",
    "contexts": ["selection"]
  });
});
```

## Set up listeners {: #listeners }

Structure extension service workers around events the extension depends on. Defining functionally relevant
events allows the service wroker to lie dormant until those events are fired and prevents the
extension from missing important triggers.

Make sure your event handlers are registered in global scope by not nesting them in functions.
This ensures that they are registered synchronously on initial script execution, which Chrome
needs in order to dispatch events to the listener right after the service worker starts up.
Notice that in this example the listener for creating bookmarks is at the top level of the script.

{% Compare 'better' %}
```js/9-11
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(() => {
  chrome.contextMenus.create({
    "id": "sampleContextMenu",
    "title": "Sample Context Menu",
    "contexts": ["selection"],
  });
});

// This will run when a bookmark is created.
chrome.bookmarks.onCreated.addListener(() => {
  // do something
});
```
{% endCompare %}

If you register the same listener asynchronously (for example, inside a `runtime.onInstalled` listener), 
the event will be dropped because the nested listener will not be registered when the browser 
attempts to dispatch it.

{% Compare 'worse' %}
```js
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(() => {
  // ERROR! Events must be registered synchronously from the start of
  // the service worker.
  chrome.bookmarks.onCreated.addListener(() => {
    // do something
  });
});
```
{% endCompare %}

Extensions can remove listeners from their background scripts by calling `removeListener()`. If all
listeners for an event are removed, Chrome will no longer load the extension's background script for
that event.

```js
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((message, sender, reply) => {
  chrome.runtime.onMessage.removeListener(event);
});
```

## Filter events {: #filters }

Use APIs that support [event filters][8] to restrict listeners to specific use cases. If an
extension is listening for the [`tabs.onUpdated`][9] event to detect when a user navigates
to a specific website, try using the [`webNavigation.onCompleted`][10] event with filters
instead, as the `tabs.onUpdated` event does not support filters.

```js
const filter = {
  url: [
    {
      urlMatches: 'https://www.google.com/',
    },
  ],
};

chrome.webNavigation.onCompleted.addListener(() => {
  console.info("The user has loaded my favorite website!");
}, filter);
```

## React to listeners {: #react }

Listeners exist to trigger functionality once an event has fired. To react to an event, structure
the desired reaction inside of the appropriate listener.

```js
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((message, callback) => {
  const tabId = getForegroundTabId();
  if (message.data === "setAlarm") {
    chrome.alarms.create({delayInMinutes: 5});
  } else if (message.data === "runLogic") {
    chrome.scripting.executeScript({file: 'logic.js', tabId});
  } else if (message.data === "changeColor") {
    chrome.scripting.executeScript(
        {func: () => document.body.style.backgroundColor="orange", tabId});
  };
});
```

## Unload extension service workers {: #unloading }

Extension service workers do not receive any kind of unload or suspend event before they are
stopped. This is because documents have [`unload`][mdn-unload] and
[`beforeUnload`][mdn-beforeunload] events, but web workers (and by extension service workers) do
not have an equivalent event.
