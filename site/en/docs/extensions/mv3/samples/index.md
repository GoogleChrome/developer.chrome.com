## Overview {: #overview }

The [Extensions sample GitHub
repository][gh-samples] provides examples of extensions that address various use cases and call appropriate Chrome
APIs. Use these to learn how extensions work or as a starting point for building your own extensions.

## Browse by category {: #categories }

The examples are currently located under the following directories:

[api-samples/][gh-api]
: Extensions designed to demonstrate the capabilities of a specific API. For example, the [Action API example][gh-action] showcases extension IU elements such as the popup, tooltip, and badges among others. 

[functional-samples/sample...][gh-functional-samples]
: Complete extensions that implement all the basic features for a given purpose.

[functional-samples/tutorial...][gh-functional-samples]
: Examples covered in the [tutorials][gs-tutorials]. A few examples include [Tabs manager][tut-tabs-man], [Focus mode][tut-fm], and [Reading time][tut-rt].

[functional-samples/cookbook...][gh-functional-samples]
: Examples demonstrating a particular concept.

[functional-samples/reference...][gh-functional-samples]
: Examples linked to documentation on this site.

To find all examples of a specific Chrome API use Github's search engine to look for "chrome.NAME_OF_API" in this repository. The following example searches for all uses of "chrome.tabs":

## Try them out {: #testing }

To test these examples in your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
1. Navigate to the directory of the extension you want to try.
1. [Load your extension locally][dev-basics-locally].

Each extension example includes a `README.md` with instructions on how the extension works.
Read the instructions carefully; each extension is different. For example, some extensions run by clicking on the extension icon, while others run automatically but only run on specific sites.
