## Overview {: #overview }

The [Extensions sample GitHub
repository][gh-samples] aims to provide examples of extensions that address various use cases and call appropriate Chrome
APIs. Use these to learn how extensions work or as a starting point for building your own extensions.

## Choose a category {: #categories }

The examples are currently located under the following directories:

[api/][gh-api]
: Includes extensions that demonstrate the capabilities of a specific API.

[examples/][gh-examples]
: a complete extension that implements all the basic features for a given purpose.

[tutorials/][gh-tutorials]
: this folder contains examples of how to build an extension over a series of steps. For example: Tabs manager, Focus mode, Reading time, etc.

To find a particular example of a Chrome API in the repository, search the repository for "chrome._API_". The following example looks for all uses of "chrome.tabs":

{% endDetails %}

## Try them out {: #testing }

To test these examples in your local machine, follow these steps

1. Clone the repository.
1. Navigate to the directory of the extension you want to try.
1. [Load your extension locally][dev-basics-locally].

Each extension example includes a `README.md` with detailed instructions on how the extension works.
Read it carefully; each extension is different. For example, some extensions run by clicking on the extension icon, others run automatically but only run specific sites, among others. 

{% Aside %}

ðŸ’¡ **TIP**: Extensions cannot run on chrome://extensions, so make sure you navigate to another page before testing an extension.
