## Overview {: #overview }

This tutorial builds an extension that simplifies the styling of the Chrome extension and
Web store documentation pages so that they are easier to read.

In this guide, weâ€™re going to explain how to do the following:

- Use the extension service worker as the event coordinator.
- Preserve user privacy through the `activeTab` permission.
- Run code when the user clicks the extension toolbar icon.
- Insert and remove a stylesheet using the [Scripting][api-scripting] API.
- Use a keyboard shortcut to execute code.

## Before you start {: #prereq }

This guide assumes that you have basic web development experience. We recommend checking out
[Development Basics][doc-dev-basics] for an introduction to the extension development workflow.

## Build the extension {: #build }

To start, create a new directory called `focus-mode` that will hold the extension's files. If you
prefer, you can download the complete source code on [GitHub][github-focus-mode].

### Step 1: Add the extension data and icons {: #step-1 }

Create a file called `manifest.json` and include the following code.

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "Focus Mode",
  "description": "Enable reading mode on Chrome's official Extensions and Chrome Web Store documentation.",
  "version": "1.0",
  "icons": {
    "16": "images/icon-16.png",
    "32": "images/icon-32.png",
    "48": "images/icon-48.png",
    "128": "images/icon-128.png"
  }
}
```

To learn more about these manifest keys, check out the Reading time tutorial that explains the extension's [metadata][tut-reading-time-step1] and [icons][tut-reading-time-step2] in more detail.

Create an `images` folder then [download the icons][github-focus-mode-icons] into it.

### Step 2: Initialize the extension {: #step-2 }

Extensions can monitor browser events in the background using the [extension's service
worker][doc-sw]. Service workers are special JavaScript environments that are loaded to handle
events and terminated when they're no longer needed.

Start by registering the service worker in the `manifest.json` file:

```json
{
  ...
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "background.js"
  },
  ...
}
```

Create a file called `background.js` and add the following code:

```js
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(() => {
  chrome.action.setBadgeText({
    text: "OFF",
  });
});
```

The first event our service worker will listen for is
[`runtime.onInstalled()`][runtime-oninstalled]. This method allows the extension to set an initial
state or complete some tasks on installation. Extensions can use the [Storage API][api-storage] and
[IndexedDB][mdn-indexeddb] to store the application state. In this case, though, since we're only handling two states, we will use the the _action's badge_ text itself to track whether the extension is 'ON' or 'OFF'.

{% Aside 'key-term' %}

The [action's badge][action-badge] is a colored banner on top of the extension action (toolbar
icon).

{% endAside %}

### Step 3: Enable the extension action {: #step-3 }

The _extension action_ controls the extensionâ€™s toolbar icon. So whenever the user clicks on the
extension action, it will either run some code (like in this example) or display a popup. Add the
following code to declare the extension action in the `manifest.json` file:

```json
{
  ...
  "action": {
    "default_icon": {
      "16": "images/icon-16.png",
      "32": "images/icon-32.png",
      "48": "images/icon-48.png",
      "128": "images/icon-128.png"
    }
  },
  ...
}
```

#### Use the activeTab permission to protect user privacy {: #active-tab}

The [`activeTab`][doc-active-tab] permission grants the extension _temporary_ ability to execute code
on the currently active tab. It also allows access to [sensitive properties][active-tab-allows] of
the current tab.

This permission is enabled when the user **_invokes_** the extension. In this case, the user invokes the
extension by clicking on the extension action.

{% Details %}
{% DetailsSummary %}
ðŸ’¡ **What other user interactions enable the activeTab permission in my own extension?**
{% endDetailsSummary %}

- Pressing a keyboard shortcut combination.
- Selecting a context menu item.
- Accepting a suggestion from the omnibox.
- Opening an extension popup.

{% endDetails %}

The `activeTab` permission allows users to _purposefully_ choose to run the extension on the
focused tab; this way, it protects the userâ€™s privacy. Another benefit is that it does not
trigger a [permission warning][doc-perms-warning].

To use the `activeTab` permission, add it to the manifest's permission array:

```json
{
  ...
  "permissions": ["activeTab"],
  ...
}
```

### Step 4: Track the state of the current tab {: #step-4 }

After the user clicks on the extension action, the extension will check if the URL matches a
documentation page. Next, it will check the state of the current tab and set the next state. Add the
following code to `background.js`:

```js
const extensions = 'https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions'
const webstore = 'https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore'

chrome.action.onClicked.addListener(async (tab) => {
  if (tab.url.startsWith(extensions) || tab.url.startsWith(webstore)) {
    // Retrieve the action badge to check if the extension is 'ON' or 'OFF'
    const prevState = await chrome.action.getBadgeText({ tabId: tab.id });
    // Next state will always be the opposite
    const nextState = prevState === 'ON' ? 'OFF' : 'ON'

    // Set the action badge to the next state
    await chrome.action.setBadgeText({
      tabId: tab.id,
      text: nextState,
    });
...
```

### Step 5: Add or remove the stylesheet {: #step-5 }

Now it's time to change the layout of the page. Create a file named `focus-mode.css` and include the
following code:

```js
body > .scaffold > :is(top-nav, navigation-rail, side-nav, footer),
main > :not(:last-child),
main > :last-child > navigation-tree,
main .toc-container {
  display: none;
}

main > :last-child {
  margin-top: min(10vmax, 10rem);
  margin-bottom: min(10vmax, 10rem);
}
```

Let's insert or remove the stylesheet using the [Scripting][api-scripting] API. Start by
declaring the `"scripting"` permission in the manifest:

```json
{
  ...
  "permissions": ["activeTab", "scripting"],
  ...
}
```

{% Aside 'success' %}

The Scripting API does not trigger a [permission warning][doc-perms-warning].

{% endAside %}

Finally, in `background.js` add the following code to change the layout of the page:

```js
  ...
    if (nextState === "ON") {
      // Insert the CSS file when the user turns the extension on
      await chrome.scripting.insertCSS({
        files: ["focus-mode.css"],
        target: { tabId: tab.id },
      });
    } else if (nextState === "OFF") {
      // Remove the CSS file when the user turns the extension off
      await chrome.scripting.removeCSS({
        files: ["focus-mode.css"],
        target: { tabId: tab.id },
      });
    }
  }
});
```

{% Details %}
{% DetailsSummary %}
ðŸ’¡ **Can I use the Scripting API to inject code instead of a stylesheet?**
{% endDetailsSummary %}

Yes! You can use [`scripting.executeScript()`][api-scripting-es] to inject JavaScript. 

{% endDetails %}

### _Optional: Assign a keyboard shortcut_ {: #step-6 }

Just for fun, let's add a shortcut to make it easier to enable or disable focus mode. Add the
`"commands"` key to the manifest.

```json
{
  ...
  "commands": {
    "_execute_action": {
      "suggested_key": {
        "default": "Ctrl+U",
        "mac": "Command+U"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `"_execute_action"` key runs the same code as the `action.onClicked()` event, so no additional
code is needed!

## Test that it works {: #try-out }

Verify that the file structure of your project looks like the following: 

{% Img src="image/BhuKGJaIeLNPW9ehns59NfwqKxF2/S86ooJMjFm5uvf906u9a.png", 
alt="The contents of the focus mode folder: manifest.json, background.js, 
focus-mode.css, and images folder.", width="700", height="468" %}

### Load your extension locally {: #locally }

To load an unpacked extension in developer mode, follow the steps in [Development
Basics][doc-dev-basics-unpacked].

### Test the extension on a documentation page {: #open-sites }

First, open any of the following pages:

- [Welcome to the Chrome Extension documentation][doc-welcome]
- [Publish in the Chrome Web Store][cws-publish]
- [Scripting API][api-scripting]

Then, click on the extension action. If you set up a keyboard shortcut (link), you can test it by pressing `Ctrl + U` or `Cmd + U`.

It should go from this:

<figure>
{% Img src="image/BhuKGJaIeLNPW9ehns59NfwqKxF2/q9DOiy5Y6m8eTp182PgP.png", alt="Focus Mode extension OFF", width="600", height="378", class="screenshot" %}
  <figcaption>
  Focus Mode extension off
  </figcaption>
</figure>

To this:

<figure>
{% Img src="image/BhuKGJaIeLNPW9ehns59NfwqKxF2/e7y4UD1rjmk1yqiVmnoP.png", 
alt="Focus Mode extension ON", width="600", height="378", class="screenshot" %}
  <figcaption>
  Focus Mode extension on
  </figcaption>
</figure>

## ðŸŽ¯ Potential enhancements {: #challenge }
