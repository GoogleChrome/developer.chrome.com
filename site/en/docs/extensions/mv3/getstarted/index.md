Welcome to the Getting Started Guides! The purpose of this page is to describe each article and how to share your feedback.

## Extension development concepts {: #concepts }

[Extensions 101][doc-ext-101]
: Briefly covers some fundamental concepts of Chrome Extension development like web technologies and commonly used extension components. In addition, it includes what to be aware of when designing and distributing an extension in the Chrome Web Store. 

[Development Basics][doc-dev-basics]
: Introduces the extension development workflow by creating a "Hello, Extensions" example. It walks through loading the extension during development, locating logs and errors, choosing a project structure, and using Typescript.

## Extension tutorials {: #tutorial } 

[Reading time][tut-reading-time]
: Itâ€™s nice to know how much time we need to finish reading an article. Reading time teaches you how to insert an element containing the estimated reading time on every extension documentation page.

[Focus mode][tut-focus-mode]
: Removing extra clutter from a page allows our minds to concentrate on the most relevant information. Focus mode demonstrates how to change the style of extension documentation pages and hides a few distracting elements.

[Tabs manager][tut-tabs-manager]
: While researching extension development, you can end up with many documentation tabs across multiple windows. Tabs Manager organizes your Chrome extension and Chrome Web store documentation tabs.

These tutorials not only teach you how to build real-world extensions but also strive to share development tips and best practices. In addition, using these extensions will improve your experience while reading the extension documentation.

Each tutorial includes the following sections:

- The task the extension will perform. 
- The lessons that will be covered.
- What you need to know before starting.
- Step-by-step instructions on how to build the extension. 
- How to load and test the extension.

If you are up for a challenge, we included a section with a few ideas on how to customize or add other features to your extension.

## Share your feedback {: #share-feedback}
