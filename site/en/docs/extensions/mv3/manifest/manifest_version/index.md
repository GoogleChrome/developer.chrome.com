---

An integer specifying the version of the manifest file format your package requires. For example:

```json
"manifest_version": 3
```

Supported values for this key are:

* `3`: Use the [Manifest V3][mv3] format and associated feature set.
* `2`: Use the [Manifest V2][mv2] format and associated feature set.

The current version is Manifest V3. Manifest V2 is also currently permitted, but will be phased out
in the future (see [Manifest V2 support timeline][mv2-timeline] for more details). There will be
other manifest versions in the future (V4 and beyond) but these aren't scheduled yet.

[mv2]: /docs/extensions/mv2/manifest/
