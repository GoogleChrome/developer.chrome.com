This value maintains the unique ID of an extension, or theme when it is loaded
during development. The following are some common use cases:

- To configure a server to only accept requests from your Chrome Extension origin.
- So that other extensions or websites can [send messages][doc-external-msg] to your extension.
- So that a website can access the [`web_accessible_resources`][doc-war] of your extension.
