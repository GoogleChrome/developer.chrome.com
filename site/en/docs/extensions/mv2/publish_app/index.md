<div class="aside aside--caution"><b>Important:</b> Chrome will be removing support for Chrome Apps on all platforms. Chrome browser and the Chrome Web Store will continue to support extensions. <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/01/moving-forward-from-chrome-apps.html"><strong>Read the announcement</strong></a> and learn more about <a href="/apps/migration"><strong>migrating your app</strong></a>.</div>

Packaged apps are published in the same way as other types of apps in the Chrome Web Store. For
detailed instructions, see [Publishing Your App][3].

**Tip:** If your app uses [Native Client][4], you can structure your application directory hierarchy
and zip file in a way that reduces the size of the user download package. For details, see [Reducing
the size of the user download package][5].
