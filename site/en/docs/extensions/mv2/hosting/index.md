  How to host your extension in the Chrome Web Store and update an extension
  that's hosted in the Chrome Web Store.
---

{% include 'partials/extensions/mv2-legacy-page.md' %}

Most extensions are hosted in the [Chrome Web Store][1] to best [protect users from malicious
extensions][2].

## Hosting {: #hosting }

All extensions are distributed to users as a special ZIP file with a `.crx` suffix. Extensions
hosted in the [Chrome Web Store][3] are uploaded through the [Developer Dashboard][4] as `.zip`
files. The [publishing][5] process automatically converts the `.zip` into a `.crx` file.

There are three exceptions to the Chrome Web Store hosting rule:

1.  Extensions that are distributed through the [enterprise policy][6].
2.  Unpacked extension directories from a local machine while in [developer mode][7].
3.  [Linux installation][8].

[Read more about the hosting policy][9].

## Updating {: #updating }

The Chrome Browser periodically checks for new versions of installed extensions and updates them
without user intervention.

To release an update to an extension, increase the number in the [`version`][version] field of the
manifest.

```json
{
  ...
  "version": "1.5",
  ...
}
```

```json
{
  ...
  "version": "1.6",
  ...
}
```

Convert the updated extension directory into a ZIP file and locate the old version in the [Developer
Dashboard][10]. Select **Edit**, upload the new package, and hit **Publish**. The browser will
automatically update the extension for users after the new version is published.
