{% Partial 'extensions/mv2-legacy-page.md' %}

An array of strings specifying the paths of packaged resources that are expected to be usable in the
context of a web page. These paths are relative to the package root, and may contain wildcards. For
example, an extension that injects a content script with the intention of building up some custom
interface for `example.com` would allow any resources that interface requires (images, icons,
stylesheets, scripts, etc.) as follows:

```json
{
  ...
  "web_accessible_resources": [
    "images/*.png",
    "style/double-rainbow.css",
    "script/double-rainbow.js",
    "script/main.js",
    "templates/*"
  ],
  ...
}
```

These resources would then be available in a webpage via the URL
`chrome-extension://[PACKAGE ID]/[PATH]`, which can be generated with the [extension.getURL][1]
method. Allowlisted resources are served with appropriate [CORS][2] headers, so they're available
via mechanisms like XHR.

A navigation from a web origin to an extension resource will be blocked unless the resource is
listed as web accessible. Note these corner cases:

- When an extension uses the [webRequest][3] or [declarativeWebRequest][4] APIs to redirect a public
  resource request to a resource that is not web accessible, such request is also blocked.
- The above holds true even if the resource that is not web accessible is owned by the redirecting
  extension.

[Content scripts][5] themselves do not need to be allowlisted.

Prior to manifest version 2 all resources within an extension could be accessed from any page on the
web. This allowed a malicious website to [fingerprint][6] the extensions that a user has installed
or exploit vulnerabilities (for example [XSS bugs][7]) within installed extensions. Limiting
availability to only resources which are explicitly intended to be web accessible serves to both
minimize the available attack surface and protect the privacy of users.

## Default Availability {: #availability }

Resources inside of packages using [`manifest_version`][8] 2 or above are **blocked by default**,
and must be allowlisted for use via this property.

Resources inside of packages using `manifest_version` 1 are available by default, but _if_ you do
set this property, then it will be treated as a complete list of all allowlisted resources.
Resources not listed will be blocked.
