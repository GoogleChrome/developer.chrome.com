The URL of the homepage for this extension. The extensions management page (chrome://extensions)
will contain a link to this URL. This field is particularly useful if you [host the extension on
your own site][1]. If you distribute your extension using the [Chrome Web Store][2], the homepage
URL defaults to the extension's own page.
