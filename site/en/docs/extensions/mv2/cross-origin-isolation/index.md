description: Overview of cross-origin isolation for extensions
---

[Cross-origin isolation](https://web.dev/cross-origin-isolation-guide/) enables a web page to use
powerful features such as <code>SharedArrayBuffer</code>. An extension can opt into cross-origin isolation by
specifying the appropriate values for [cross_origin_embedder_policy][coep-refdoc] and
[cross_origin_opener_policy][coop-refdoc] manifest keys. For example, a manifest like the snippet 
below will allow the extension to opt into cross-origin isolation for its origin.


```json
{
    "name": "CrossOriginIsolation",
    "manifest_version": 3,
    "version": "1.1",
    "cross_origin_embedder_policy": {
      "value": "require-corp"
    },
    "cross_origin_opener_policy": {
      "value": "same-origin"
    },
    ....
}
```

Opting into cross-origin isolation allows the extension to use powerful APIs like SharedArrayBuffers
in its cross-origin isolated contexts. However, it does also come with certain side-effects. See
[Making your website "cross-origin isolated" using COOP and COEP](https://web.dev/coop-coep/)
for more information on this. 


{% Aside 'caution' %}
Even if an extension opts into cross-origin isolation, not all extension contexts will be
cross-origin isolated. For example, cross-origin isolation [is not fully
implemented](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1131404) for service and shared
workers currently. Similarly, a cross-origin isolated extension's web-accessible subframe on a
regular web page is not considered cross-origin isolated currently.
