As Manifest V3 approaches full feature parity with Manifest V2, we'll progressively phase out Manifest V2.

We're still working on the timeline of the MV2 phase-out plan, so keep an eye out for it in the
coming months. We will provide at least 6 months between a timeline announcement and any experiments
deprecating MV2 features.

For more information, see our [most recent post][mailing-list-update] on the chromium-extensions
mailing list.
