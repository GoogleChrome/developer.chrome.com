{% Aside 'caution' %}

**Important:** Chrome will be removing support for Chrome Apps on all platforms. Chrome browser and
the Chrome Web Store will continue to support extensions. [**Read the announcement**][1] and learn
more about [**migrating your app**][2].

{% endAside %}

Packaged apps are published in the same way as other types of apps in the Chrome Web Store. For
detailed instructions, see [Publishing Your App][3].

**Tip:** If your app uses [Native Client][4], you can structure your application directory hierarchy
and zip file in a way that reduces the size of the user download package. For details, see [Reducing
the size of the user download package][5].
