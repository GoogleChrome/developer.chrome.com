!!!.aside.aside--caution

**Important:** Chrome will be removing support for Chrome Apps on all platforms. Chrome browser and
the Chrome Web Store will continue to support extensions. [**Read the announcement**][1] and learn
more about [**migrating your app**][2].

!!!

This value can be used to control the unique ID of an extension, app, or theme when it is loaded
during development.

!!!.aside.aside--note

**Note:** You don't usually need to use this value. Instead, write your code so that the key value
doesn't matter by using [relative paths][3] and [extension.getURL][4].

!!!

To get a suitable key value, first install your extension from a `.crx` file (you may need to
[upload your extension][5] or [package it manually][6]). Then, in your [user data directory][7],
look in the file `Default/Extensions/_<extensionId>_/_<versionString>_/manifest.json`. You will see
the key value filled in there.
