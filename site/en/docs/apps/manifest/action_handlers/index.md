{% Aside 'caution' %}

**Important:** Chrome will be removing support for Chrome Apps on all platforms. Chrome browser and
the Chrome Web Store will continue to support extensions. [**Read the announcement**][1] and learn
more about [**migrating your app**][2].

{% endAside %}

The `action_handlers` manifest property declares which user actions or intents the application
supports; these can serve as alternate launch points for your application. This API is only
available on ChromeOS.

This list contains one or more of the `ActionType` values specified in the `ActionType` entry of
[app.runtime.onLaunched][3].

## Sample manifest.json {: #manifest }

```json
{
  "name": "My note app",
  "action_handlers": ["new_note"],
  ...
}
```
