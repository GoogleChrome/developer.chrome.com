## Learn about Chrome Web Store benefits {: #about-web-store }

For those not familiar with the store, it provides several benefits to users and developers.

For users:

- Added security—all apps and extensions are checked for Malware signals.
- All apps are maintained with the latest version the developer has published.
- Ratings and reviews provide a great way to see the quality of applications.

For developers:

- You can upload your app once and know that it will be distributed to all users.
- Payments and subscriptions are built in.
- Your app is more discoverable to users.
- Tools to help you manage bugs and reviews from users.

## Upload your app via the Developer Dashboard {: #developer-dashboard }

The Chrome Web Store has a special dashboard for developers that lets you upload new applications
and update existing ones.

The process of uploading apps is simple:

1.  Compress your application's root directory (the folder containing the _manifest.json_ file) into
    a .zip file.
2.  Go to the [Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard][5] and log in with a developer-verified Google
    Account. (If you don't have a verified account, you can [sign up][6] for a nominal fee.)
3.  Click **Add new item**.
4.  Accept the terms and services agreement to continue.
5.  Use the **choose file** dialog box to find the .zip file in your system. Select that file to
    upload.

You are nearly done. If you are not quite ready for the next step, you can save the draft for later,
or you can publish it to a group of testers.

## Add promotional materials {: #promotional-metadata }

Before you can publicly publish your app, you need to add promotional assets and extra meta
information about your application.You should see a screen that looks like this:

The below fields are mandatory:

- A **detailed description** of your application. Write your description to entice users to download
  your app.
- A 128x128 **icon** to display in the store. You may re-use your app icon here.
- At least one 1280x800 or 640x400 **screenshot** or YouTube **video** to show off what your app
  does.
- A 440x280 **small tile icon** that will be displayed on the Chrome Web Store wall.
- The **primary category** where your app should be listed.
- Your app's **language** to help users find it.

Once you are happy with everything, you can now publish your application to the public.

world.
