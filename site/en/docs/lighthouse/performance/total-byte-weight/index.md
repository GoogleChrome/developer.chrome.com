  Learn how to improve your web page's load time by reducing the total file
  size of resources you serve to your users.

Large network payloads are highly correlated with long load times.
They also cost users money;
for example, users may have to pay for more cellular data.
So, reducing the total size of your page's network requests is good
for your users' experience on your site _and_ their wallets.

## How the Lighthouse network payload audit fails

[Lighthouse](/docs/lighthouse/overview/)
shows the total size in [kibibytes (KiB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibibyte) of all resources requested by your page.
The largest requests are presented first:

</figure>

Based on [HTTP Archive data](https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-the-web?start=latest#bytesTotal),
the median network payload is between 1,700 and 1,900&nbsp;KiB.
To help surface the highest payloads,
Lighthouse flags pages whose total network requests exceed 5,000&nbsp;KiB.

## How to reduce payload size

Aim to keep your total byte size below 1,600&nbsp;KiB.
This target is based on the amount of data that can be
theoretically downloaded on a 3G connection
while still achieving a [Time to Interactive](http://web.dev/tti/) of 10&nbsp;seconds or less.

Here are some ways to keep payload size down:

- Defer requests until they're needed.
  See the [PRPL Pattern](https://web.dev/apply-instant-loading-with-prpl/) for one possible approach.
- Optimize requests to be as small as possible. Possible techniques include:
  - [Minify and compress network payloads](https://web.dev/reduce-network-payloads-using-text-compression/).
  - [Use WebP instead of JPEG or PNG for your images](https://web.dev/serve-images-webp/).
  - [Set the compression level of JPEG images to 85](https://web.dev/use-imagemin-to-compress-images/).
- Cache requests so that the page doesn't re-download the resources
  on repeat visits. (See the [Network reliability landing page](https://web.dev/reliable/)
  to learn how caching works and how to implement it.)

## Stack-specific guidance

### Angular

Apply [route-level code splitting](https://web.dev/route-level-code-splitting-in-angular/) to
minimize the size of your JavaScript bundles. Also, consider precaching assets
with the [Angular service
worker](https://web.dev/precaching-with-the-angular-service-worker/).

### Drupal

Consider using [Responsive Image
Styles](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/mobile-guide/responsive-images-in-drupal-8)
to reduce the size of images loaded on your page. If you are using Views to show
multiple content items on a page, consider implementing pagination to limit the
number of content items shown on a given page.

### Joomla

Consider showing excerpts in your article categories (one popular solution is a "read more"
link), reducing the number of articles shown on a given page, breaking your long
posts into multiple pages, or using a plugin to lazy-load comments.

### WordPress

Consider showing excerpts in your post lists (you can use the "more" tag), reducing
the number of posts shown on a given page, breaking your long posts into
multiple pages, or using a plugin to lazy-load comments.
