The browser's [renderer process](/blog/inside-browser-part3/)
is what turns your code into a web page that your users can interact with.
By default, the [main thread](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Main_thread)
of the renderer process typically handles most code:
it parses the HTML and builds the DOM, parses the CSS and applies the specified styles,
and parses, evaluates, and executes the JavaScript.

The main thread also processes user events.
So, any time the main thread is busy doing something else,
your web page may not respond to user interactions,
leading to a bad experience.

## How the Lighthouse main thread work audit fails

[Lighthouse](/docs/lighthouse/overview/)
flags pages that keep the main thread busy for longer than 4&nbsp;seconds
during load:

To help you identify the sources of main thread load,
Lighthouse shows a breakdown of where CPU time was spent
while the browser loaded your page.

## How to minimize main thread work

The sections below are organized based on the categories that Lighthouse reports.
See [The anatomy of a frame](https://aerotwist.com/blog/the-anatomy-of-a-frame/)
for an overview of how Chromium renders web pages.

See [Do less main thread work](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/speed/get-started#main)
to learn how to use Chrome DevTools to investigate exactly what your main thread is doing
as the page loads.
