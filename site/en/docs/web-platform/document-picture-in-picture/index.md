The [Document Picture-in-Picture API][spec] makes it possible to open an always-on-top window that can be populated with arbitrary HTML content. It extends the existing [Picture-in-Picture API for `<video>`] that only allows an HTML `<video>` element to be put into a Picture-in-Picture window.

The Picture-in-Picture window in the Document Picture-in-Picture API is similar to a blank same-origin window opened via [`window.open()`], with some differences:
- The Picture-in-Picture window floats on top of other windows.
- The Picture-in-Picture window never outlives the opening window.
- The Picture-in-Picture window cannot be navigated.
- The Picture-in-Picture window position cannot be set by the website.

## Use cases

### Custom video player

A website can provide a Picture-in-Picture video experience with the existing [Picture-in-Picture API for `<video>`], however it is very limited. The existing Picture-in-Picture window accepts few inputs, and has limited ability for styling them. With a full Document in Picture-in-Picture, the website can provide custom controls and inputs (for example, [captions], playlists, time scrubber, liking and disliking videos) to improve the user's Picture-in-Picture video experience.

### Video conferencing

It is common for users to leave the browser tab during a video conferencing session for various reasons (for example, presenting another tab to the call or multitasking) while still wishing to see the call, so it's a prime use case for Picture-in-Picture. Once again, the current experience a video conferencing website can provide via the [Picture-in-Picture API for `<video>`] is limited in style and input. With a full Document in Picture-in-Picture, the website can easily combine multiple video streams into a single PiP window without having to rely on [canvas hacks] and provide custom controls such as sending a message, muting another user, or raising a hand.

### Productivity
 
Research has shown that users need more ways to be productive on the web. Document in Picture-in-Picture gives web apps the flexibility to accomplish more. Whether it's text editing, note-taking, task lists, messaging and chat, or design and development tools, web apps can now keep their content always accessible.

## Interface

### Properties

`documentPictureInPicture.window`
: Returns the current Picture-in-Picture window if any. Otherwise, returns `null`.

### Methods

`documentPictureInPicture.requestWindow(options)`
: Returns a promise that resolves when a Picture-in-Picture window is opened.
  The promise rejects if it's called without a user gesture.
  The `options` dictionary contains the optional following members:

  `width`
  : Sets the initial width of the Picture-in-Picture window.

  `height`
  : Sets the initial height of the Picture-in-Picture window.

### Events

`documentPictureInPicture.onenter`
: Fired on `documentPictureInPicture` when a Picture-in-Picture window is opened.

## Examples

The following HTML sets up a custom video player and a button element to open the video player in a Picture-in-Picture window.

```html
<div id="playerContainer">
  <div id="player">
    <video id="video"></video>
  </div>
</div>
<button id="pipButton">Open Picture-in-Picture window</button>
```

### Open a Picture-in-Picture window

The following JavaScript calls `documentPictureInPicture.requestWindow()` when the user clicks the button to open a blank Picture-in-Picture window. The returned promise resolves with a Picture-in-Picture window JavaScript object. The video player is moved to that window using [`append()`].

```js
pipButton.addEventListener('click', async () => {
  const player = document.querySelector("#player");

  // Open a Picture-in-Picture window.
  const pipWindow = await documentPictureInPicture.requestWindow();

  // Move the player to the Picture-in-Picture window.
  pipWindow.document.body.append(player);
});
```

### Set the size of the Picture-in-Picture window

To set the size of the Picture-in-Picture window, set the `width` and `height` options of `documentPictureInPicture.requestWindow()` to the desired Picture-in-Picture window size. Chrome may clamp the option values if they are too large or too small to fit a user-friendly window size.

```js
pipButton.addEventListener("click", async () => {
  const player = document.querySelector("#player");

  // Open a Picture-in-Picture window whose size is
  // the same as the player's.
  const pipWindow = await documentPictureInPicture.requestWindow({
    width: player.clientWidth,
    height: player.clientHeight,
  });

  // Move the player to the Picture-in-Picture window.
  pipWindow.document.body.append(player);
});
```

### Copy style sheets to the Picture-in-Picture window

To copy all CSS style sheets from the originating window, loop through [`styleSheets`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Document/styleSheets) explicitly linked into or embedded in the document and append them to the Picture-in-Picture window. Note that this is a one-time copy.

```js
pipButton.addEventListener("click", async () => {
  const player = document.querySelector("#player");

  // Open a Picture-in-Picture window.
  const pipWindow = await documentPictureInPicture.requestWindow();

  // Copy style sheets over from the initial document
  // so that the player looks the same.
  [...document.styleSheets].forEach((styleSheet) => {
    try {
      const cssRules = [...styleSheet.cssRules].map((rule) => rule.cssText).join('');
      const style = document.createElement('style');

      style.textContent = cssRules;
      pipWindow.document.head.appendChild(style);
    } catch (e) {
      const link = document.createElement('link');

      link.rel = 'stylesheet';
      link.type = styleSheet.type;
      link.media = styleSheet.media;
      link.href = styleSheet.href;
      pipWindow.document.head.appendChild(link);
    }
  });

  // Move the player to the Picture-in-Picture window.
  pipWindow.document.body.append(player);
});
```

{% Aside %}
The `copyStyleSheets` option was supported in a previous version of the specification. It is [not the case anymore](https://github.com/WICG/document-picture-in-picture/pull/79).
{% endAside %}

### Handle when the Picture-in-Picture window closes

Listen to the window `"pagehide"` event to know when the Picture-in-Picture window gets closed (either because the website initiated it or the user manually closed it). The event handler is a good place to get the elements back out of the Picture-in-Picture window as shown below.

```js
pipButton.addEventListener("click", async () => {
  const player = document.querySelector("#player");

  // Open a Picture-in-Picture window.
  const pipWindow = await documentPictureInPicture.requestWindow();

  // Move the player to the Picture-in-Picture window.
  pipWindow.document.body.append(player);

  // Move the player back when the Picture-in-Picture window closes.
  pipWindow.addEventListener("pagehide", (event) => {
    const playerContainer = document.querySelector("#playerContainer");
    const pipPlayer = event.target.querySelector("#player");
    playerContainer.append(pipPlayer);
  });
});
```

Close the Picture-in-Picture window programmatically by using the [`close()`] method.

```js
// Close the Picture-in-Picture window programmatically. 
// The "pagehide" event will fire normally.
pipWindow.close();
```

### Listen to when the website enters Picture-in-Picture

Listen to the `"enter"` event on `documentPictureInPicture` to know when a Picture-in-Picture window is opened. The event contains a `window` object to access the Picture-in-Picture window.

```js
documentPictureInPicture.addEventListener("enter", (event) => {
  const pipWindow = event.window;
});
```

### Access elements in the Picture-in-Picture window

Access elements in the Picture-in-Picture window either from the object returned by `documentPictureInPicture.requestWindow()`, or with `documentPictureInPicture.window` as shown below.

```js
const pipWindow = documentPictureInPicture.window;
if (pipWindow) {
  // Mute video playing in the Picture-in-Picture window.
  const pipVideo = pipWindow.document.querySelector("#video");
  pipVideo.muted = true;
}
```

### Handle events from the Picture-in-Picture window

Create buttons and controls and respond to user's input events such as `"click"` as you would do normally in JavaScript.

```js
// Add a "mute" button to the Picture-in-Picture window.
const pipMuteButton = pipWindow.document.createElement("button");
pipMuteButton.textContent = "Mute";
pipMuteButton.addEventListener("click", () => { 
  const pipVideo = pipWindow.document.querySelector("#video");
  pipVideo.muted = true;
});
pipWindow.document.body.append(pipMuteButton);
```

## Feature detection

To check if the Document Picture-in-Picture API is supported, use:

```js
if ('documentPictureInPicture' in window) {
  // The Document Picture-in-Picture API is supported.
}
```
