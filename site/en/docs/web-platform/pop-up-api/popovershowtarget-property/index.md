The `popOverShowTarget` property of the [`HTMLInputElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement) and [`HTMLButtonElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLButtonElement) interfaces creates a trigger element that shows an associated hidden [pop-up](/docs/web-platform/pop-up-api/). It is the DOM definition of the HTML [`popovershowtarget`](/docs/web-platform/pop-up-api/popovershowtarget-attribute) attribute.

## Value

A string value equal to the ID of the pop-up element that you want to show, to associate the two.

## Example

```js
const popup = document.getElementById('my-popup-btn');

// get
popup.popOverShowTarget;

// set
popup.popOverShowTarget = 'my-popup';
```
