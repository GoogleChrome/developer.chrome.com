The `popoverShowTarget` property of the [`HTMLInputElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement) and [`HTMLButtonElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLButtonElement) interfaces creates a trigger element that shows an associated hidden [popover](/docs/web-platform/popover-api/). It is the DOM definition of the HTML [`popovershowtarget`](/docs/web-platform/popover-api/popovershowtarget-attribute) attribute.

## Value

A string value equal to the ID of the popover element that you want to show, to associate the two.

## Example

```js
const popover = document.getElementById('my-popover-btn');

// get
popover.popoverShowTarget;

// set
popover.popoverShowTarget = 'my-popover';
```
