The **`popoverhidetarget`** attribute creates a trigger element that dismisses an associated shown [popover](/docs/web-platform/popover-api/).

It can be used on the [`<button>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button) and [`<input>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) elements.

## Values

The attribute takes a string value equal to the ID of the popover element that you want to dismiss, to associate the two.

## Example

```html
<button popoverhidetarget="my-popover">Dismiss popover</button>
```

## Browser compatibility
