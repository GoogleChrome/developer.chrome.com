The **`popover`** [global attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes) is an [enumerated](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Enumerated) attribute that turns an element into a [popover](/docs/web-platform/popover-api/).

It can be used on any HTML element that makes sense as a popover.

## Values

The attribute can have any of the following values:

`auto` (default value)
: The popover exhibits the standard behavior explained at [The Popover API: concepts and usage](/docs/web-platform/popover-api/#concepts-and-usage).
    
`manual`
: Manual popovers cannot be light dismissed, they can only be dismissed by an explicit trigger element (created for example using [`popovertoggletarget`](/docs/web-platform/popover-api/popovertoggletarget-attribute)) or by JavaScript (using [`hidePopOver()`](/docs/web-platform/popover-api/hidepopover-method)), and they don't automatically dismiss previously-shown popovers.

## Example

```html
<p id="my-popover" popover>Hello!</p>
<p id="my-popover" popover="auto">Hello!</p>
<p id="my-popover" popover="manual">Hello!</p>
```

## Browser compatibility

* It is enabled by default in [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/) for local testing.  
* Register for the [Origin Trial](/origintrials/#/view_trial/4500221927649968129) if you want to test it in a production environment. Read [Getting started with Chrome's origin trials](/docs/web-platform/origin-trials/) for more information.
