The `popoverhide` event of the [`Element`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element) interface fires on a [popover](/docs/web-platform/popover-api/) element when it is dismissed.

## Syntax

Use the event name in methods like [`addEventListener()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener), or set the equivalent event handler property.

```js
addEventListener("popoverhide", (event) => {});
onpopuphide = (event) => {};
```

## Example

```js
const popover = document.getElementById('my-popover');
const popoverToggleBtn = document.getElementById('my-popover-btn');

// Event listener version
popover.addEventListener('popoverhide', () => {
  popoverToggleBtn.textContent = 'Show popover';
})

// Event handler property version
popover.onpopoverhide = () => {
  popoverToggleBtn.textContent = 'Show popover';
}
```

## Browser compatibility

* It is enabled by default in [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/) for local testing.  
* Register for the [Origin Trial](/origintrials/#/view_trial/4500221927649968129) if you want to test it in a production environment. Read [Getting started with Chrome's origin trials](/docs/web-platform/origin-trials/) for more information.
