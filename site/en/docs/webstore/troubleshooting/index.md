This page is provided to help you understand why an item was rejected or removed from the Chrome Web
Store, and to understand how you can rectify the problem.

Each section describes the issues that correspond to a particular category of violation.

## Excessive permissions {: #excessive-permissions }

Corresponds to notification ID: Purple Potassium

This section explains discusses extensions that are in violation of the following section of the
Chrome Web Store [developer program policies][1]:

```text
Use of Permissions

Request access to the narrowest permissions necessary to implement your Product's features or
services. If more than one permission could be used to implement a feature, you must request those
with the least access to data or functionality.

Don't attempt to "future proof" your Product by requesting a permission that might benefit
services or features that have not yet been implemented.
```

This policy is to prevent excessive and unnecessary access to user data by extensions.

### Common reasons for removal/rejection {: #common-reasons-for-removalrejection }

- The extension is requesting a permission but not using it.
- The extension is requesting a permission that is not required to implement the functionality.

### How can you rectify this? {: #how-can-you-rectify-this }

- Remove any permission that is not being used.
- Request only the narrowest permission required to implement your extension's functionality.

## Missing or insufficient metadata {: #no-metadata }

Content Policies

⋮

If your Product has a blank description field or is missing an icon or screenshots, it will be
rejected. If any of your Product's content, title, icon, description or screenshots contains false
or misleading information, we may remove it.
```

This policy is to ensure quality of the products on the Chrome Web Store and for users to know about
the product that they are downloading before they download.

Corresponds to notification ID: Red Nickel/Red Potassium/Red Silicon

This section explains discusses extensions that are in violation of the following section of the
Chrome Web Store [developer program policies][3]:

```text
Impersonation or Deceptive Behavior:

Don't pretend to be someone else, and don't represent that your product is authorized by, endorsed
by, or produced by another company or organization, if that is not the case. Developers should not
divert users or provide links to any other site that mimics Chrome Web Store or passes itself off
as Chrome Web Store. Your Product and its user experience also must not mimic functionality or
warnings from a user's operating system or browser. Any changes to device settings must be made
with the user's knowledge and consent and be easily reversible by the user.

We do not allow Products which deceive or mislead users, including in the content, title,
description, or screenshots. Don't misrepresent the functionality of your Product or include
non-obvious functionality that doesn't serve the primary purpose of the product. Descriptions of
your Product must directly state the functionality so that users have a clear understanding of the
Product they are adding. For example, Products should not contain:

- Claimed functionalities which are not possible to implement (E.g. "Who has viewed your IG
  account")
- Developer or Product names which misrepresent their current status or performance on the Chrome
  Web Store (E.g. "Editor's Choice" or "Number One")

If your Product has a blank description field or is missing an icon or screenshots, it will be
rejected. If any of your Product's content, title, icon, description or screenshots contains false
or misleading information, we may remove it.

```text
Extensions Quality Guidelines

An extension must have a single purpose that is narrow and easy-to-understand. Do not create an
extension that requires users to accept bundles of unrelated functionality. If two pieces of
functionality are clearly separate, they should be put into two different extensions, and users
should have the ability to install and uninstall them separately. Common violations include:

- Functionality that displays product ratings and reviews, but also injects ads into web pages.
- Toolbars that provide a broad array of functionality or entry points into services are better
  delivered as separate extensions, so that users can select the services they want.
- Email notifiers combined with a news aggregator.
- PDF converters which also aim to change a users default search engine.
```

This policy is aimed at maintaining the quality of extensions on the Chrome Web Store. As mentioned
in the policy text, if there are multiple unrelated functionalities, they should be provided in
separate extensions.

### Common reasons for removal/rejection {: #common-reasons-for-removalrejection_10 }

- The extension is providing 2 or more functionalities in the same extension

  extension's metadata.
- If your extension is offering a primary functionality and also injecting ads, then remove the
  primary functionality or stop injecting ads.
