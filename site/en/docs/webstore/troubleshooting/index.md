  Guidelines for understanding why an item was rejected or removed from the Chrome Web Store
  and how to fix the problem.
---

This page is provided to help you understand why your extension was rejected or removed from the
Chrome Web Store and how you can fix the violation.

Each section in this document describes the issues that correspond to a particular category of
violation. In order to make it easier to reference specific violations, the Chrome Web Store assigns
each violation a human-readable ID. These IDs are composed of two words: a color and an element. For
example, Yellow Magnesium corresponds to the general class of errors where the extension does not
behave as expected.

## Functionality not working {: #does-not-work }

Corresponds to notification ID: `Yellow Magnesium`

The intent of this policy is to ensure a minimum quality level for all items published in the Chrome
Web Store. Extensions should provide the functionality described in their listings and, if they
cannot, communicate that to the user.

### Common reasons for removal/rejection {: #common-reasons-for-removalrejection_18 }

- Your item has packaging errors. Examples:
    - There are files mentioned in your manifest that are not present in your package. This is most
      commonly seen with image files.
    - The path or name of the files mentioned in your package are incorrect
- A functionality in your item is not working due to a server side issue at the time of reviewing.
- Your item is just not functioning as it expected based on the item's listing.

### How can you rectify this? {: #how-can-you-rectify-this_18 }

- Test the code that you submit to the web store locally.
    - Test the exact files that you submit to the web store, not just a local development version of
      your extension. This may mean extracting resources from the package that you submitted.
    - Unpacked and packed extensions can have different behaviors. Make sure that Chrome loads a
      packed version of your extension as expected by manually [packing your
      extension][docs-pack-extension] and dragging the generated .crx file onto the
      chrome://extensions page.
- Verify that your submission contains the files you expect at the paths you expect.
    - Ensure that all the files mentioned in your `manifest.json` are present in the package and
      their names and paths are correct.
    - Check for [case sensitivity][wiki-case-sensitivity] bugs. For example, say your background
      script was named  `Background.js`, but your manifest.json references  `background.js`. Some
      file systems will treat these as the same file while others will treat them as two distinct
      files, causing Chrome to error when loading the extension.
- Make sure that your extensions clearly communicate error conditions to the user.
    - It should be as obvious as possible for new users to understand how your extension works and
      verify it's behaving correctly.
    - If your extension requires an account or special network environment, make sure that
      requirement is communicated to the user. If these conditions are not met, consider ways that
      you can make the user aware that the extension will not work as expected.
    - Test your experience on an unreliable internet connection (e.g. [lie-fi][lie-fi]). The
      extension's UI should gracefully handle request timeouts, HTTP 400 and 500 errors, certificate
      timeouts, and other such error conditions.
- If you cannot determine why the reviewer thought that your extension was not working as expected,
  [contact developer support][dev-support] to request more information about the rejection.
    - In some cases, reviewers may encounter issues you cannot reproduce. Use the [developer support
      contact form][dev-support] to request clarification about what features or user flows did not
      behave as expected.

### Relevant policy {: #does-not-work-policy }

This section addresses extensions that are in violation of the following section of the Chrome Web
Store [developer program policies][docs-dpp-functionality]:

{% Aside %}

**Spam & Placement in the Store**

**Functionality:** Do not post an extension with a single purpose of installing or launching another
app, theme, webpage, or extension. Extensions with broken functionality—such as dead sites or
non-functioning features—are not allowed.

{% endAside %}

## Excessive permissions {: #excessive-permissions }

Corresponds to notification ID: `Purple Potassium`

The intent of this policy is to prevent excessive and unnecessary access to user data by extensions.

### Common reasons for removal/rejection {: #common-reasons-for-removalrejection }

- The extension is requesting a permission but not using it.
- The extension is requesting a permission that is not required to implement the functionality the
  extension provides.

### Commonly misunderstood permissions {: #misunderstood-perms }

#### activeTab {: #misunderstood-perms-activetab }

This permission grants temporary access to a tab in response to a user invoking your extension. It
DOES NOT grant passive access to the user's currently focused tab.

- **When is it required?**
    - When you need temporary access to a tab after the user invokes your extension.
- **When is it NOT required?**
    - When the extension has access to broad host permissions or host permissions for the specific
      domains that are relevant to the extension's operations.
    - When using methods on the [action][api-action], [browserAction][api-browser-action],
      [pageAction][api-page-action] APIs. These APIs can use activeTab to grant temporary host
      permissions for the currently focused tab, but they do not need activeTab to function.
    - When using [tabs.sendMessage][api-tabs-sendmessage] to send a message to a specific tab.
    - For basic use of [tabs.query][api-tabs-query], such as querying [the user's current
      tab][api-tabs-get-current-tab].

#### tabs {: #misunderstood-perms-tabs }

This permission ONLY grants access to the `url`, `pendingUrl`, `title`, or `favIconUrl` properties
of Tab objects.

- **When is it required?**
    - When an extension does not have broad host access, but needs to be able to read sensitive data
      like the URL of an arbitrary tab.
- **When is it NOT required?**
    - When using methods on the [tabs][api-tabs] API.
    - When the extension has access to broad host permissions. Host permissions grant the extension
      access to the same data as well as other capabilities.

#### cookies {: #misunderstood-perms-cookies }

This exposes the [chrome.cookies][api-cookies] API and allows the extension to modify cookies on
origins that it has host permissions to access.

- **When is it required?**
    - When accessing [chrome.cookies][api-cookies] from the extension's [background
      context][docs-service-workers] or in another context using the extension's origin such as an
      extension's popup.
    - When using [chrome.cookies][api-cookies] to interact with detailed cookie data, such as
      [SameSite][mdn-samesite-cookie] values.
- **When is it NOT required?**
    - When using [`document.cookie`][mdn-document-cookie] or the [Cookie Store
      API][mdn-cookie-store].

#### storage {: #misunderstood-perms-storage }

The storage permission exposes the [chrome.storage][api-storage] API to the extension.

- **When is it required?**
    - When using the [chrome.storage][api-storage] API.
- **When is it NOT required?**
    - When using the [Web Storage API][mdn-web-storage] (`document.localStorage`,
      `document.sessionStorage`) or [IndexedDB][mdn-indexeddb].

### How can you rectify this? {: #how-can-you-rectify-this }

- Review the list of [commonly misunderstood permissions][section-misunderstood-perms] to see if you
  have committed one of the mistakes listed there.
- Request only the narrowest permission required to implement your extension's functionality.
- Remove all unused permissions from your manifests.json's `permissions`, `optional_permissions`,
  and `host_permissions` arrays.
- If the message from review does not contain enough information to determine which permissions were
  considered excessive, [contact developer support][dev-support] to request more information about
  the rejection.
- If the reviewer indicated that your extension did not use a given permission but you believe it
  does, [contact developer support][dev-support] to appeal the decision and to provide a detailed
  explanation of why the permission is necessary and how it is used.

### Relevant policy {: #excessive-permissions-policy }

This section addresses extensions that are in violation of the following section of the Chrome Web
Store [developer program policies][docs-dpp-permissions]:

{% Aside %}

**Use of Permissions**

Request access to the narrowest permissions necessary to implement your Product's features or
services. If more than one permission could be used to implement a feature, you must request those
with the least access to data or functionality.

Don't attempt to "future proof" your Product by requesting a permission that might benefit services
or features that have not yet been implemented.

{% endAside %}

## Missing or insufficient metadata {: #no-metadata }

Corresponds to notification ID: `Yellow Zinc`

The intent of this policy is to ensure a basic quality level of all items in the Chrome Web Store.
Users should be able to understand what features and functionality an item provides based on its
listing before they choose to install it. Items that misrepresent their capabilities or fail to
disclose important information may be subject to enforcement action.

### Common reasons for removal/rejection

- The extension is missing an icon, title, screenshot, or description.
- The extension's title is not meaningful or is misleading.
- The extension's screenshots or description is not meaningful or doesn't adequately explain the
  functionality it provides.

### How can you rectify this?

- Ensure the extension has a meaningful icon, title, screenshots, and description.
- Clearly explain the extension's functionality in the description and screenshots.
    - List all major features the extension provides.
- Review the rectification guidance in the [Functionality not working][section-does-not-work]
  section.

### Relevant policy

This section addresses extensions that are in violation of the following section of the Chrome Web
Store [developer program policies][docs-dpp-impersonation]:

{% Aside %}

**Content Policies**

Impersonation or Deceptive Behavior:

: If your product has a blank description field or is missing an icon or screenshots, it will be
  rejected. If any of your product's content, title, icon, description, or screenshots contains
  false or misleading information, we may remove it.

{% endAside %}

## Deceptive behavior {: #deceptive-behavior }

Corresponds to notification IDs: `Red Nickel`, `Red Potassium`, and `Red Silicon`

The intent of this policy is to prevent extensions from deceiving or misleading the users.

### Common reasons for removal/rejection {: #common-reasons-for-removalrejection_2 }

- The extension does not provide the functionality described in the metadata<sup>1</sup>.
- The extension provides different functionality than what is described in the metadata<sup>1</sup>.
- The extension performs actions not mentioned in the metadata<sup>1</sup>.
- The extension impersonates another entity<sup>2</sup>.
- The extension copies or is copied from another entity<sup>2</sup>.
- The extension pretends to be authorized by another entity<sup>2</sup>.

<sup>1</sup> Metadata means the title, icon, description, screenshots, and other developer-provided
information specified in the developer dashboard.

<sup>2</sup> An entity here means any company, organization, or extension.

### How can you rectify this? {: #how-can-you-rectify-this_2 }

- Ensure the functionality promised by your extension is working as intended.
- Clearly state the functionality of your extension in the metadata.
- Do not perform actions not mentioned in the metadata.
- Do not pretend to be another entity.
- Do not copy another extension. You may offer the same functionality as another extension but do
  not copy from other extensions.
- Do not pretend that your extension was endorsed, authorized or produced by another entity.

### Relevant policy {: #deceptive-behavior-policy }

This section addresses extensions that are in violation of the following section of the Chrome Web
Store [developer program policies][docs-dpp-impersonation]:

{% Aside %}

**Content Policies**

Impersonation or Deceptive Behavior:

: Don't pretend to be someone else, and don't represent that your product is authorized by, endorsed
  by, or produced by another company or organization, if that is not the case.

: Developers should not divert users or provide links to any other site that mimics the Chrome Web
  Store or passes itself off as the Chrome Web Store. Your Product and its user experience also must
  not mimic functionality or warnings from a user's operating system or browser.

: Any changes to device settings must be made with the user's knowledge and consent and be easily
  reversible by the user.

: We do not allow products that deceive or mislead users, including in the content, title,
  description, or screenshots.

: Don't misrepresent the functionality of your product or include non-obvious functionality that
  doesn't serve the primary purpose of the product. Descriptions of your product must directly state
  the functionality so that users have a clear understanding of the product they are adding. For
  example, products should not contain:

  - Claimed functionalities that are not possible to implement (e.g. "Who has viewed your social
    media account") or which are not directly provided by the extension (e.g. file converters which
    only link to other file conversion services)
  - Any metadata that misrepresents the extension's or developer's current status or performance on
    the Chrome Web Store (e.g. "Editor's Choice" or "Number One")

: If your product has a blank description field or is missing an icon or screenshots, it will be
  rejected. If any of your product's content, title, icon, description, or screenshots contains
  false or misleading information, we may remove it.

{% endAside %}

## User data policy - disclosure policy {: #udp-disclosure-policy }

Corresponds to notification ID: `Purple Lithium`

The User Data Privacy policy is a broad category under which several other policies are gathered.
All of these policies have to do with the handling and transmission of sensitive information about
the user.

This policy applies to all extensions that collect user data. This particular section is to ensure
that users are aware of what data is collected, and how it is collected, used, and shared.

### Common reasons for removal/rejection {: #common-reasons-for-removalrejection_3 }

- The extension is collecting user data but has not provided a privacy policy.
- The privacy policy is not provided in the designated field—a common mistake here is providing the
  privacy policy in the description.
- The privacy policy URL is not working.
- The privacy policy is not accessible.
- The privacy policy URL is not leading to privacy policy.
- The privacy policy does not talk about user data collection, usage, handling or sharing.

### How can you rectify this? {: #how-can-you-rectify-this_3 }

- Add a valid, working and accessible link to your privacy policy [in the designated
  field][docs-publish-setup].
    - Visit the Chrome Web Store item listing for your extension to verify that a privacy policy
      link appears in the "Additional Information" box and that the link works as expected.
- Ensure the privacy policy talks about data collection, usage, handling, and sharing.
- If you have done the above but are still encountering review issues, [contact developer
  support][dev-support] to request clarification or appeal the verdict.

### Relevant policy {: #udp-disclosure-policy-policy }

This section addresses extensions that are in violation of the following section of the Chrome Web
Store [developer program policies][docs-dpp-privacy-policy]:

{% Aside %}

**Personal or Sensitive User Data**

Posting a Privacy Policy & Secure Transmission

: If your Product handles personal or sensitive user data (including personally identifiable
  information, financial and payment information, health information, authentication information,
  website content and resources, form data, web browsing activity, user-provided content and
  personal communications), then your Product must:

  - Post a privacy policy, and
  - Handle the user data securely, including transmitting it via modern cryptography.

{% endAside %}

## Illegal activities {: #illegal-activities }

Corresponds to notification ID: `Grey Zinc`

The intent of this policy is to prevent the use of extensions and the Chrome Web Store to promote or
participate in illegal activities.

### Common reasons for removal/rejection {: #common-reasons-for-removalrejection_4 }

The extension is doing anything illegal. See the policy extract for specific examples.

### How can you rectify this? {: #how-can-you-rectify-this_4 }

- If this is the primary functionality of your extension, there is no direct rectification. You
  should unpublish your extension.
- If this was an unintended functionality, then remove the content or services that are in violation
  and resubmit your extension.
- If you would like more information about why this verdict was applied to your extension,
  [developer support][dev-support] may be able to provide you with further details.

### Relevant policy {: #illegal-activities-policy }

This section addresses extensions that are in violation of the following section of the Chrome Web
Store [developer program policies][docs-dpp-illegal-activities]:

{% Aside %}

**Content Policies**

Illegal Activities:

: Keep it legal. Don't engage in or promote unlawful activities in your product, such as rape,
  illegal sex work, or the sale of prescription drugs without a prescription.. We will remove
  content which promotes, glorifies, or encourages dangerous or illegal activity that may result in
  physical harm to those involved.

{% endAside %}

## Online gambling {: #gambling }

Corresponds to notification ID: `Grey Copper`

### Common reasons for removal/rejection {: #common-reasons-for-removalrejection_5 }

- Providing online gambling within an extension.
- Facilitating online gambling on other sites through the extension.
    - For example, providing functionality to calculate the odds of a bet on a gambling site. While
      this extension does not directly allow the user to gamble, it does facilitate online gambling.
- Directing users to an online gambling site.
- Providing games of skill that offer prizes of cash or other value.

### How can you rectify this? {: #how-can-you-rectify-this_5 }

- If this is the primary functionality of your extension, then it is recommended to unpublish your
  extension.

  value.

{% endAside %}

## Pornographic content {: #pornography }

Corresponds to notification ID: `Grey Lithium`

The intent of this policy is to prevent the use of extensions and the Chrome Web Store as a platform
for pornography.

### Common reasons for removal/rejection {: #common-reasons-for-removalrejection_6 }

- The extension itself contains sexually explicit material.
- The extension is displaying or providing sexually explicit material.
- The extension is directing users to pornographic sites.
- The extension is primarily meant to enhance sites that provide sexually explicit material.

### How can you rectify this? {: #how-can-you-rectify-this_6 }

- If the primary purpose of your extension is to provide access to sexually explicit material or
  enhance pornographic sites, you should unpublish your extension; such extensions are not allowed
  on the Chrome Web Store.
- If this was an unintended functionality, then remove the content or services that are in violation
  and resubmit your extension.
- Make sure that your extension does not contain sexually explicit images, video, text, etc.
- If your extension provides integrations with adult-oriented sites, make sure that the "Mature
  content" flag is enabled for your extension in the [developer dashboard][mature-content].

### Relevant policy {: #pornography-policy }

This section addresses extensions that are in violation of the following section of the Chrome Web
Store [developer program policies][docs-dpp-sexually-explicit]:

{% Aside %}

**Content Policies**

Sexually Explicit Material:

: We don't allow content that contains nudity, graphic sex acts, sexually explicit material, or
  content that drives traffic to commercial pornography sites. We also don't allow content that
  promotes incest, bestiality, necrophilia, or non-consensual sexual acts. Google has a
  zero-tolerance policy against child pornography. If we become aware of content with child
  pornography, we will report it to the appropriate authorities and delete the Google Accounts of
  those involved with the distribution. Content which contains non-sexual nudity - such as artistic,
  educational, scientific, or cultural nudity - is generally allowed, but may impact the visibility
  of your Product.

{% endAside %}

## Hate content {: #hate }

Corresponds to notification ID: `Grey Magnesium`

The intent of this policy is to prevent the use of extensions and the Chrome Web Store as a platform
to spread hateful content.

### Common reasons for removal/rejection {: #common-reasons-for-removalrejection_7 }

- Providing content or directing users to content that is considered hate speech. See the policy
  text for additional details.

### How can you rectify this? {: #how-can-you-rectify-this_7 }

- If promotion or distribution of hate speech is a primary feature  of your extension, then you
  should unpublish the extension as such content is not permitted in the Chrome Web Store.
- If your extension provides access to user-generated content, you must ensure that you have content
  moderation in place to prevent users from sharing hate speech.
- If your extension contains functionality intended to draw negative attention to an individual's
  membership in one of the groups outlined in the policy text, you should remove this functionality
  from your extension.

### Relevant policy {: #hate-policy }

This section addresses extensions that are in violation of the following section of the Chrome Web
Store [developer program policies][docs-dpp-hate-speech]:

{% Aside %}

**Content Policies**

Hate Speech:

: We don't allow content advocating against or inciting hatred towards groups of people based on
  their race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status, nationality,
  sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or any other characteristic that is associated with
  systematic discrimination or marginalization.

  Additionally, the visibility of your Product may be impacted if it contains generally hateful
  content not covered by the above definition.

{% endAside %}

## Not family safe {: #not-family-safe }

Corresponds to notification ID: `Grey Nickel`

The intent of this policy is to prevent non-family-safe content from reaching an inappropriate
audience.

### Common reasons for removal/rejection {: #common-reasons-for-removalrejection_8 }

- The extension has content that is not suitable for audiences of all ages and the extension has not
  been marked 'Mature'.

### How can you rectify this? {: #how-can-you-rectify-this_8 }

- Either remove the violating content or mark the extension as containing "Mature content" in your
  [developer dashboard][mature-content] and resubmit the extension.

### Relevant policy {: #not-family-safe-policy }

This section addresses extensions that are in violation of the following section of the Chrome Web
Store [developer program policies][docs-dpp-content-policies]:

{% Aside %}

**Content Policies:**

Our content policies apply to your Product's content, including any ads it shows to users and any
user-generated content it hosts or links to. Further, they apply to any content from your developer
account that is publicly displayed in Chrome Web Store, including your developer name and the
landing page of your listed developer website. Products that include content that may not be
suitable for all ages should be marked "Mature" on the [Developer Dashboard][mature-content].

{% endAside %}

## Violent content {: #violence }

Corresponds to notification ID: `Grey Potassium`

The intent of this policy is to prevent the use of extensions and the Chrome Web Store as a platform
to spread the content mentioned in the relevant policy text.

### Common reasons for removal/rejection {: #common-reasons-for-removalrejection_9 }

- The extension contains content or is directing users to content mentioned in the policy text,

### How can you rectify this? {: #how-can-you-rectify-this_9 }

- If providing access to violent or bullying content is one of the primary features of your
  extension, unpublish the extension; such extensions are not permitted in the Chrome Web Store.
- If this was an unintended functionality, then remove the content or services that are in violation

### Relevant policy {: #violence-policy }

This section addresses extensions that are in violation of the following section of the Chrome Web
Store [developer program policies][docs-dpp-bullying]:

{% Aside %}

**Content Policies**

Violent or Bullying Behavior:

: Depictions of gratuitous violence are not allowed. Products should not contain materials that
  threaten, harass, or bully other users. For example, Products should not contain:

  - Content which makes a specific threat of serious harm against an individual person or a defined
    group of people.
  - Content whose predominant purpose is to single out another person for abuse, malicious attack,
    or ridicule. Content that results in the unwanted sexualization of a person, including malicious
    claims about a person's sexual activities, sexual orientation, or gender identity.
  - A series of posts/comments/photos that, taken together, clearly have the primary intention of
    harassment, even if each individual piece of content is not severe.

{% endAside %}

## Single purpose {: #single-use }

Corresponds to notification IDs: `Red Magnesium`, `Red Copper`, and `Red Lithium`

This policy is aimed at maintaining the quality of extensions on the Chrome Web Store. As mentioned
in the policy text, if there are multiple unrelated functionalities, they should be provided in
separate extensions.

### Common reasons for removal/rejection {: #common-reasons-for-removalrejection_10 }

- The extension provides two or more purposes in the same extension (for example an extension
  providing image format conversion and bibliography generation).
- The extension provides one or more unrelated additional functionalities using the extension's
  action icon.
- The following are considered distinct purposes. Extensions that provide any of the features listed
  below may not provide any other functionality.
    - Replacing any single [override page][docs-override-page].
    - Using [override settings][docs-override-settings] to replace the default search provider.
    - Injecting ads into web pages.

See the [Single Purpose FAQ][docs-single-purpose-faq] for additional information.

### How can you rectify this? {: #how-can-you-rectify-this_10 }

- Narrow the functionality of your extension to clearly fit within one well-defined purpose and
  ensure that purpose is clearly described in your extension's metadata.
- If your extension is offering some functionality and also injecting ads, then either stop
  injecting ads or remove all other functionality besides ad injection.
- Chrome does not support optional new tab pages. If you wish to provide some functionality and an
  optional new tab page, you should separate the new tab page into a standalone extension.
- Don't offer another unrelated functionality in the extension's action icon.

### Relevant policy {: #single-purpose-policy }

This section addresses extensions that are in violation of the following section of the Chrome Web
Store [developer program policies][docs-dpp-single-purpose]:

{% Aside %}

**Extensions Quality Guidelines**

Single Purpose:

An extension must have a single purpose that is narrow and easy-to-understand. Do not create an
extension that requires users to accept bundles of unrelated functionality. If two pieces of
functionality are clearly separate, they should be put into two different extensions, and users
should have the ability to install and uninstall them separately.

Common violations include:

- Functionality that displays product ratings and reviews, but also injects ads into web pages.
- Toolbars that provide a broad array of functionality or entry points into services are better
  delivered as separate extensions, so that users can select the services they want.
- Email notifiers combined with a news aggregator.
- PDF converters which also aim to change a user's default search engine.

{% endAside %}

## User data policy - prominent disclosure {: #udp-prominent-disclosure }

Corresponds to notification ID: `Purple Nickel`

The User Data Privacy policy is a broad category under which several other policies are gathered.
All of these policies have to do with the handling and transmission of sensitive information about
the user.

This section of the policy aims to ensure that users are aware of the data that is being collected
and that user consent is obtained before data collection. Be aware that extensions may only collect
data in direct support of their single purpose. See the [Limited Use of User
Data][docs-dpp-limited-use] policy for additional information.

### Common reasons for removal/rejection {: #common-reasons-for-removalrejection_11 }

- The extension is not prominently disclosing how the user data is being used.
- User consent is not obtained before data collection

### How can you rectify this? {: #how-can-you-rectify-this_11 }

- Prominently disclose to the user what data is being collected and how it will be handled. This
  information must be provided in the extension's Privacy Policy and may be provided elsewhere.
- Ensure data is collected only if the user consents to it.
    - Prominent disclosure of data collection in the extension's Chrome Web Store listing is
      sufficient.
    - Collecting data that is not prominently disclosed in the Chrome Web Store listing is allowed
      so long as this data collection is consistent with the extension's single purpose, the user is
      informed of the data collection before it begins, and the user consents to the data
      collection.
- Consider providing the user with ways to opt out of data collection from within the extension's
  [options page][docs-options].
- Consider providing users with an "offline mode" that only stores user data locally.

### Relevant policy {: #udp-prominent-disclosure-policy }

This section addresses extensions that are in violation of the following section of the Chrome Web
Store [developer program policies][docs-dpp-prominent-disclosure]:

{% Aside %}

**Personal or Sensitive User Data**

Prominent Disclosure Requirement

: If your Product handles personal or sensitive user data that is not closely related to
  functionality described prominently in the Product's Chrome Web Store page and user interface,
  then prior to the collection, it must:

  - Prominently disclose how the user data will be used, and
  - Obtain the user's affirmative consent for such use.

{% endAside %}

## User data policy - secure transmission {: #udp-secure }

Corresponds to notification ID: `Purple Copper`

The User Data Privacy policy is a broad category under which several other policies are gathered.
All of these policies have to do with the handling and transmission of sensitive information about
the user.

This particular section is to ensure that user data is being handled securely.

### Common reasons for removal/rejection {: #common-reasons-for-removalrejection_12 }

- The extension is not transmitting user data securely.
- The data is being transmitted to an unsecure domain

### How can you rectify this? {: #how-can-you-rectify-this_12 }

- Ensure data is securely transmitted.
    - Don't transmit user data over HTTP. If possible, use secure protocols for all requests.
    - Don't encode data in request headers or query parameters, even over HTTPS. Headers and request
      URLs often appear in server logs, which can unintentionally leak this information.
    - See [Safe HTTP methods][mdn-safe-http] for additional information.

Tip: Use the Chrome DevTools or other network monitoring tools to watch the network requests the
