  An overview of how users find items on the Chrome Web Store, and how our editors select items to
  feature.
---

We strive to make it easy for users to discover great items on the Chrome Web Store. A positive
discovery experience means making it simple for our users to find the items they know and love, as
well as new and undiscovered items. From browsing the homepage to searching by title, we want users
to find the best item to fit their needs. Learn more about discovery on the Chrome Web Store below.

## Search {: #search }

Chrome Web Store search is a key tool for users to find relevant and popular items. When users
search for an item, search returns a list of items that are ranked based on a number of criteria,
including metadata from your item's listing page. Making sure that your store listing page is
complete, accurate and optimized is important to ensuring your item is discoverable through search.
Learn more about [crafting a great listing page][best-listing].

## Categories {: #categories }

Categories on the Chrome Web Store organize items based on their main function. Users can browse
category pages, like Shopping, Productivity or Fun, to find relevant items to install. Developers
select a category for their item in the Developer Dashboard, which determines which category it will
appear under in the store. Categories are only available for extensions at this time.

## Extensions Homepage {: #homepage }

The homepage is where we highlight great extensions and themes that we think users will love. Users
come to this page to find new and interesting items recommended by our editors. Chrome editors
curate items to be featured in merchandised collections and the rotating marquee based on a variety
of factors including performance, design, usefulness, relevancy and breadth of appeal. Items
featured on the homepage must follow our general [best practices][best-practices] to be considered,
but there is no set checklist developers can follow to guarantee being featured. Developers cannot
pay to be featured on the homepage. The best thing a developer can do to increase their chances of
being featured on the homepage is to build a useful, high-quality extension that is a joy to use.

## Editors' Picks {: #editors-picks }

Chrome editors handpick items to be featured as Editors' Picks to inspire users and recognize
exceptional extensions. Editors' Picks items are featured in the Editors' Picks collection on the
homepage. We look for high-quality items that offer consistent, best-in-class experiences to users.
Like the homepage, items chosen for Editors' Picks must follow our general [best
practices][best-practices] to be considered, but there is no set checklist of requirements to
guarantee being featured. Developers cannot pay to be featured as an Editors' Pick.
