description: How to delete a developer or group publisher account on Chrome Web Store.
---

This page describes how to delete a CWS accountâ€”either a developer or group publisher account.

## About account deletion {: #about-account-deletion }

Items in the Chrome Web Store are associated with developer and publisher accounts. There are a few
things you need to understand before you delete an account:

- Account deletion is permanent. There is no "undo" for this action.
- You can't delete an account that still has published items. If you have published items, make sure
  to unpublish them before you try and delete the account.
- Group publisher accounts can only be deleted by the owner or manager of the associated Google
  Group.

## How to delete a developer account {: #how-to-delete-a-developer-account }

To delete a developer account, first make sure you've unpublished any published items. Then, go to
your account page on the Chrome Web Store [Developer Dashboard][1]. Scroll down to the **Developer
Account** section:

Click on **Delete developer account** to permanently delete the developer account.

## How to delete a group publisher account {: #how-to-delete-a-group-publisher-account }

To delete a group publisher account, select it using the "Publisher" pulldown at the top of the
account page, then proceed as described above. Make sure that you have unpublished any items
associated with the group publisher account.

With the group publisher account selected, you'll see a **Group publisher account** section:
