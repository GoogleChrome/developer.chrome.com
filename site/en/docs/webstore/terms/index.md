**Developer Agreement**

## Definitions {: #definitions }

Google: Google Inc., a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at 1600 Amphitheatre
Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.

Developer or You: Any person or company who is registered to develop Products for publication and
distribution on the Web Store in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

Web Store: The Google Chrome Web Store site operated by Google, where Developers can publish
Products for direct distribution to users of Google Chrome.

Payment Processor(s): Any party authorized by Google to provide payment processing services that
enable Developers with optional Payment Accounts to charge Google Chrome users for Products
distributed via the Web Store.

Payment Account: A financial account issued by a Payment Processor to a Developer that authorizes
the Payment Processor to collect and remit payments on the Developer's behalf for Products sold via
the Web Store. In order to use the Web Store payments processing services, Developers must be
approved by a Payment Processor for a Payment Account and maintain their account in good standing to
charge for Products distributed in the Web Store.

Products: Software, content and digital materials created for use in connection with Google Chrome
and distributed via the Web Store.

## 1\. Introduction {: #introduction }

The Web Store is a publicly available site on which Developers can publish Products for distribution
and use in connection with Google Chrome. In order to publish Products on the Web Store, you must
acquire and maintain a valid Google account.

## 2\. Accepting this Agreement {: #accepting }

2.1 Your use of the Web Store to distribute Products is governed by a legal agreement between you
and Google consisting of the Google Terms of Service (found at
[https://policies.google.com/terms][7]), Google Chrome and Chrome OS Additional Terms of Service
(found at [http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/eula_text.html][8]) and this Google Chrome Web Store
Developer Agreement (together, the "Agreement"). In order to use the Web Store to distribute
Products, you may agree to this Agreement by clicking to accept where this option is made available
to you or continuing to use the Web Store to distribute Products in accordance with section 14. You
may not publish Products on the Web Store if you do not accept this Agreement.

2.2 You may not use the Web Store and may not enter into this Agreement if you are (a) not of legal
age to form a binding contract with Google, or (b) a person or entity barred from using Google
Chrome software under the laws of the United States or other countries including the country in
which you are resident or from which you use the Google Chrome software.

2.3 You represent and warrant that you have full power, capacity, and authority to accept this
Agreement. If you are agreeing to be bound by this Agreement on behalf of your employer or other
entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your employer or such
entity to this Agreement. If you do not have the requisite authority, you may not accept the
Agreement or use the Web Store on behalf of your employer or other entity.

## 3\. Pricing and Payments {: #pricing }

3.1 This Agreement covers both Products you choose to distribute for free and Products for which you
charge a fee.

In order to charge a fee for your Products using the Web Store payment processing services, you must
have a valid Payment Account under a separate agreement with a Payment Processor. If you already
have a Payment Account with a Payment Processor before signing up for the Web Store, then the terms
of this Agreement shall supersede your Payment Account terms and condition for Products sold via the
Web Store.

You may set the price for your Products in the currencies permitted by the Payment Processor. The
Web Store may display to users the price of Products in their native currency, but it is not
responsible for the accuracy of currency rates or conversion

The price you set for Products will determine the amount of payment you will receive. A Transaction
Fee, as defined below, will be charged on the sales price and apportioned to the Payment Processor.
The remainder (sales price less Transaction Fee) will be remitted to you. The "Transaction Fee" is
set forth at [http://developers.google.com/chrome/web-store/docs/#builtin][9] and may be revised by
Google from time to time. Developer is responsible for determining if a Product is taxable and the
applicable tax rate for the Payment Processor to collect for each taxing jurisdiction where Products
are sold. Developer is responsible for remitting taxes to the appropriate taxing authority.

3.2 If you charge a fee for your Product without using the Payment Processor and the Web Store
payment processing Services, then you will not be charged a Transaction Fee, and you assume sole
responsibility and liability for all related transactions and authentications, records, and taxes.
Google will have no obligations with respect to such Products, including without limitation
obligations to track and process payments, authenticate paid or previously paid downloads, maintain
payment records, or pay, report, or charge taxes.

3.3 You may also choose to distribute Products for free. If the Product is free, you will not be
charged a Transaction Fee. You may not collect future charges from users for copies of the Products
that those users were initially allowed to download for free. This is not intended to prevent
distribution of free trial versions of the Product with an "upsell" option to obtain the full
version of the Product: Such free trials for Products are encouraged. In this Agreement, "free"
means there are no charges or fees of any kind for use of the Product.

3.4 Special Refund Requirements. If you use the Payment Processor, the Payment Processor's standard
terms and conditions regarding refunds will apply except the following terms apply to your
distribution of Products on the Web Store.

Products that can be previewed by the buyer (such as themes): No refund is required or allowed.

Products that cannot be previewed by the buyer (such as applications): You authorize Google to give
the buyer a full refund of the Product price if the buyer requests the refund within 30 minutes
after purchase.

3.5 You Support Your Product. You agree to supply and maintain valid and accurate contact
information that will be displayed in each product detail page on the Store and made available to
users for customer support and legal purposes. For paid Products or in-app transactions, you must
respond to customer support inquiries within three (3) business days, and within 24 hours to any
support or Product concerns stated to be urgent by Google.

Failure to provide adequate support for your Products may result in low Product ratings, less
prominent product exposure, or in some cases removal from the Web Store, such as if the extension no
longer functions as described.

Except in cases when multiple disputes are initiated by a user with abnormal dispute history,
billing disputes received by Payment Processor for Products sold for less than
$10 may be automatically charged back to the Developer, in addition to any handling fees charged by the Payment Processor. Chargeback requests for Products $10
or more will be handled in accordance with the Payment Processor's standard policy.

3.6 Reinstalls. Users are allowed unlimited reinstalls of each application distributed via the Web
Store, provided however that if you remove a Product(s) from the Web Store pursuant to clauses (i),
(ii), (iii) or (iv) of Section 7.1, such Product(s) shall be removed from all portions of the Web
Store and users shall no longer have a right or ability to reinstall the affected Products. If you
charge a fee for your Product without using the Payment Processor, then you are solely responsible
for maintaining records of users who have previously paid for your Products, and Google will not be
responsible for determining whether users attempting to reinstall your Products have previously paid
for such Products.

## 4\. Use of the Web Store by You {: #use }

4.1 Except for the license rights granted by you in Section 5 below, Google agrees that it obtains
no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under this Agreement in or to any of
Products, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in those applications.

4.2 You agree to use the Web Store only for purposes that are permitted by (a) this Agreement and
the Google Chrome Web Store Program Policies
[http://developers.google.com/chrome/web-store/program_policies][10] and (b) any applicable law,
regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including
any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant
countries).

4.3 You agree that if you use the Web Store to distribute Products, you will protect the privacy and
legal rights of users. If the users provide you with, or your Product accesses or uses, user names,
passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the users aware that
the information will be available to your Product, and you must provide legally adequate privacy
notice and protection for those users. Further, your Product may only use that information for the
limited purposes for which the user has given you permission to do so. If your Product stores
personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely and only for as long as
it is needed. But if the user has opted into a separate agreement with you that allows you or your
Product to store or use personal or sensitive information directly related to your Product (not
including other products or applications) then the terms of that separate agreement will govern your
use of such information. If the user provides your Product with Google Account information, your
Product may only use that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited
purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If your Product (or any part
thereof) targets or directs itself to users under the age of consent, you must ensure that such
Product (or any part thereof) is compliant with applicable laws or regulations at all times
(including as applicable, the U.S. Children's Online Privacy (COPPA) and E.U. General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR)).

4.4 Prohibited Actions.

4.4.1 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the Web Store, including the
development or publication of Products or other materials, that violates the Google Chrome Web Store
Program Policies, or that:

1.  knowingly violates a third party's terms of service,
2.  violates any applicable laws or regulations,
3.  interferes with, disrupts, damages, harms, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the machines,
    hardware, devices, servers, networks, data, or other properties or services of any third party
    including, but not limited to, Google Chrome users, Google or any network operator, or
4.  creates a spammy user experience, whether by posting repetitive content or misleading
    information about an application's purpose,
5.  infringes on the intellectual property rights of others,
6.  enables the unauthorized download of streaming content or media,
7.  displays (via text, images, video, or other media) or links to:

8.  illegal content,
9.  invasions of personal privacy or violations of the right of publicity,
10. content that interferes with the functioning of any servers, networks, or services of other
    parties,
11. promotions of hate or incitement of violence,
12. violations of intellectual property rights, including patent, copyright, trademark, trade
    secret, or other proprietary right of any party, or
13. pornography, obscenity, nudity, or sexual activity.

4.4.2 You agree not to access (or attempt to access) the Web Store by any means other than through
the interface that is provided by Google, unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a
separate agreement with Google.

4.4.3 You may not divert users or provide links to any other site that mimics the Web Store or
passes itself off as the Web Store. For the avoidance of doubt, you may offer Products as access
points to paid services for which customers have registered and provided payment information.

4.4.4 Your Product may not use or include the NPAPI plug-in unless you obtain Google's prior
permission for such use.

4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or
to any third party for) any Products you publish in the Web Store and for the consequences of your
actions (including any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer) by doing so.

4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or
to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under this Agreement, any applicable third
party contract or terms of service, or any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences
(including any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer) of any such breach.

4.7 Product Ratings. The Web Store will allow users to rate Products. Along with other factors,
Product ratings may be used to determine the placement of Products on the Web Store with higher
rated Products generally given better placement, subject to Google's right to change placement at
Google's sole discretion. For new Developers without Product history, Google may use or publish
performance measurements such as uninstall rates to identify or remove Products that are not meeting
acceptable standards, as determined by Google. Google reserves the right to display Products to
users in a manner that will be determined at Google's sole discretion.  
Your Products may be subject to user ratings to which you may not agree. You may contact Google if
you have any questions or concerns regarding such ratings at
[http://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-apps/][11].

4.8 Marketing Your Product. You will be responsible for uploading your Products to the Web Store,
providing required Product information to users, and accurately disclosing the security permissions
necessary for the Product to function on user machines, hardware, or other devices. Products that
are not properly uploaded will not be published in the Web Store.

## 5\. License Grants {: #license }

5.1 You grant to Google and its affiliates a worldwide, nonexclusive, and royalty-free license to:
(a) host, link to, copy, translate, publicly perform, publicly display, test, distribute and
otherwise use the Products and any content contained in, accessed by, or transmitted through the
Products according to the publishing options selected by you on the Product upload page of the Web
Store and (b) copy, perform, display, and use the Product for administrative and demonstration
purposes in connection with the operation and marketing of the Web Store.

5.2 You grant to the user a non-exclusive, worldwide, and perpetual license to perform, display, and
use the Products and any content contained in, accessed by, or transmitted through the Products in
connection with Google Chrome. If you choose, you may include a separate end user license agreement
(EULA) in your Product that will govern the user's rights to the Products in lieu of the previous
sentence.

5.3 Google may use consultants and other contractors in connection with the performance of
obligations and exercise of rights under this agreement, provided that such consultants and
contractors will be subject to the same obligations as Google. After termination of this Agreement,
Google will not distribute your Product, but may retain and use copies of the Product for support of
the Web Store, Google Chrome extensions, and Google Chrome.

5.4 You represent and warrant that you have all and will maintain all necessary rights to grant the
licenses to the Products and any content contained in, accessed by, or transmitted through the
Products to Google, its affiliates, and users of your Products.

5.5 Except for the license rights granted in this Agreement, (a) you retain all rights in the
Products; and (b) each party retains all rights it would have independent of this Agreement,
including rights under the U.S. Copyright Act or analogous laws in other jurisdictions. Google
acknowledges and agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
under this Agreement in or to any content that you submit, post, transmit or display on, or through,
the Products, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in that content (whether
those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist).
Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with Google, you agree that you are responsible for
protecting and enforcing those rights and that Google has no obligation to do so on your behalf.

## 6\. Brand Features and Publicity {: #brand }

6.1 "Brand Features" means the trade names, trade marks, service marks, logos, domain names, and
other distinctive brand features of each party, respectively, as owned (or licensed) by such party
from time to time.

6.2 Each party shall own all right, title and interest, including without limitation all
intellectual property rights, relating to its Brand Features. Except to the limited extent expressly
provided in this Agreement, neither party grants, nor shall the other party acquire, any right,
title or interest (including, without limitation, any implied license) in or to any Brand Features
of the other party. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Developer grants to
Google and its affiliates a limited, non-exclusive license during the term of this Agreement to
display Developer Brand Features for use in connection with the Web Store and in order to fulfill
its obligations under this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement gives Developer a right to use any
of Google's trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand
features.

6.3 Publicity. Google and its affiliates may include Developer Brand Features, screenshots, videos,
and demonstrations of your Products and any content contained in, accessed by, or transmitted
through the Products in presentations, marketing materials, marketing events, developer events,
financial reports, website listings (including links to your website), press releases, and customer
lists (which includes, without limitation, customer lists posted on Google websites) for purposes of
marketing the Google Chrome Web Store, Google products and services, or publicizing your Product.
Google grants to Developer a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use the
Google Chrome Brand Features for the Term of this Agreement solely for marketing purposes and only
in accordance with the Google Chrome Brand Guidelines located at
[https://chrome.google.com/extensions/intl/en/branding.html][12].

## 7\. Product Takedowns, Review, and Updates {: #review }

7.1 Your Takedowns. You may remove your Products from future distribution via the Web Store at any
time, but you must comply with this Agreement (and with the Payment Processor's Payment Account
terms of service if you use the Payment Processor) for any Products distributed through the Web
Store, including but not limited to refund requirements. Removing your Products from future
distribution via the Web Store does not (a) affect the license rights of users who have previously
purchased or downloaded your Products, (b) remove your Products from user machines, hardware, or
other devices, or from any part of the Web Store where previously downloaded applications are stored
on behalf of users, or (c) change your obligation to deliver or support Products or services that
have been previously purchased or downloaded by users. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event
will Google maintain on any portion of the Web Store (including, without limitation, the part of the
Web Store where previously purchased or downloaded applications are stored on behalf of users) any
Product that you have removed from the Web Store and provided written notice to Google that such
removal was due to (i) an allegation of infringement, or actual infringement, of any copyright,
trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent or other intellectual property right of any person,
(ii) an allegation of defamation or actual defamation, (iii) an allegation of violation, or actual
violation, of any third party's right of publicity or privacy, or (iv) an allegation or
determination that such Product does not comply with applicable law.

If you remove a Product from the Web Store pursuant to clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this
Section 7.1, and an end user purchased such Product within a year before the date of takedown, at
Google's request, you must refund to the affected end user all amounts paid by such end user for
such affected Product, less the portion of the Transaction Fee specifically allocated to the credit
card/payment processing for the associated transaction.

7.2 Google Review and Takedowns. While Google is not obligated to monitor the Products or their
content, Google may at any time review or test your Products and their source code for compliance
with this Agreement, the Google Chrome Web Store Program Policies, and any other applicable terms,
obligations, laws, or regulations, and may use automated means to conduct such review. Google
retains the right to refuse to include a Product on the Web Store. You may be required to provide
information about yourself (such as identification or contact details) as part of the registration
process for the Web Store, or as part of your continued use of the Services. You agree that any
information you give to Google will always be accurate, correct and up to date. As part of the
specification for your Product, Google may ask that you include in the file for your Product
information such as your name and email address. Google may use this information when featuring the
Product in our directory or for other uses. If Google is notified by you or otherwise becomes aware
and determines that a Product or any portion thereof or your Brand Features; (a) violates the
intellectual property rights or any other rights of any third party; (b) violates any applicable law
or is subject to an injunction; (c) is pornographic, obscene or otherwise violates Google's hosting
policies or other terms of service as may be updated by Google from time to time; (d) is being
published or distributed by you improperly; (e) may create liability for Google or any third party;
(f) is deemed by Google to have a virus or is deemed to be malware, spyware or have an adverse
impact on Google's or a third party's network; (g) violates the terms of this Agreement or the
Google Chrome Web Store Program Policies; or (h) the display of the Product is impacting the
integrity of Google servers (i.e., users are unable to access such content or otherwise experience
difficulty), Google may prevent the Product from being made available in the Web Store, remove the
Product from the Web Store, remotely disable or remove the Product from user systems or devices, or
flag, filter, modify related materials (including but not limited to descriptions, screenshots, or
metadata), or reclassify the Product. If you have any questions or concerns regarding a removal, you
may contact us at [http://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-apps/][13]. Google
reserves the right to suspend or bar any Product from the Web Store.

In the event that your Product is involuntarily removed because it is defective, malicious,
infringes intellectual property rights of another person, defames, violates a third party's right of
publicity or privacy, or does not comply with applicable law, and an end user purchased such Product
within a year before the date of takedown: (i) you must refund to Google, all amounts received, plus
any associated fees (i.e. chargebacks and payment transaction fees), and (ii) Google may withhold
from your future sales the amount in subsection (i) above.

7.3 From time to time, Google Chrome may check for available updates to Products, including but not
limited to bug fixes or enhanced functionality. If you upload an update for your Product to the Web
Store, you agree that such update will be automatically requested, downloaded, and installed without
further notice to you. Google makes no guarantees regarding the timing of such updates. For the
avoidance of doubt, updates to Products are subject to the same terms and conditions as the
Products, including without limitation Section 7.2 of this Agreement (Google Review and Takedowns).

7.4 If you are a business user based in the EU or the UK, you may also apply to resolve a dispute
under this Agreement with mediation, find more details about the mediators we're willing to engage
with and instructions about how to request mediation [here][14]. Except as required by applicable
law, mediation is voluntary and neither you nor Google are obliged to settle disputes through
mediation.

## 8\. Your Developer Credentials {: #credentials }

8.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
credentials or developer keys that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself
and that you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
credentials.

8.2 Google may limit the number of Products that you or the company or organization you work for may
publish to the Web Store. If your company or organization desires to publish additional products, a
request may be made to Google who will determine, based on factors such as good standing, whether
and how many additional products may be published. Good standing may be determined based on factors
such as whether the company or organization has engaged in deceptive or malicious activities or has
any outstanding policy violations.

8.3 Google may suspend or terminate your right to publish Products on the Web Store for any reason,
including but not limited to: (a) violation of the Agreement or the Google Chrome Web Store Program
Policies, or (b) infringement upon any intellectual property rights, including copyright. For more
information on Google's copyright policies, use [this tool][15].

## 9\. Privacy and Information {: #privacy }

9.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the Web Store, Google may collect certain usage
statistics from the Web Store and user machines, devices, or other hardware, including information
on how the Web Store and Products are being used.

9.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the Web Store for users and
Developers and is maintained in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy. To ensure the improvement
of Products, limited aggregate data may be available to you upon written request.

## 10\. Terminating this Agreement {: #terminating }

10.1 This Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as set out
below.

10.2 If you want to terminate this Agreement, you must provide Google with thirty (30) days prior
notice and cease your use of any relevant developer credentials.

10.3 Google may at any time, terminate this Agreement with you if:  
(A) you have breached any provision of this Agreement; or  
(B) Google is required to do so by law; or  
(C) Google decides to no longer provide the Web Store.

## 11\. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES {: #disclaimer }

11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE Web Store IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT
THE Web Store IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO THE TIMING, FREQUENCY, OR IMPLEMENTATION OF DISTRIBUTION OF
ANY UPDATES TO YOUR PRODUCTS.

11.2 YOUR USE OF THE Web Store AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF
THE Web Store IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO
YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.

11.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

## 12\. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY {: #limitation }

YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS DISTRIBUTORS, SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU, INCLUDING ANY
LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN
AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.

## 13\. Indemnification {: #indemnification }

13.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless
Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and
against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any and all losses,
liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of or
accruing from (a) your use of the Web Store in violation of this Agreement, the Web Store Program
Policies, or any applicable laws or regulations, (b) your Product that infringes any copyright,
trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent or other intellectual property right of any person or
defames any person or violates their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any third party claims
arising out of or relating to your Product or your use of the Web Store.

13.2 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the
applicable Payment Processors (which may include Google and/or third parties) and the Payment
Processors' affiliates, directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all third
party claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any and all losses, liabilities, damages,
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of or accruing from taxes
related to Your distribution of Product distributed via the Web Store.

## 14\. Changes to the Agreement {: #changes }

Google may make changes to this Agreement from time to time. When these changes are made, Google
will make a new copy of the Agreement available on the Web Store site
[http://developers.google.com/chrome/web-store/terms][16]. Google will also post a notification on
the Web Store site describing the modifications made. The changes will become effective, and will be
deemed accepted by you, (a) immediately for those who become Developers after the notification is
posted, or (b) for pre-existing Developers, the modified Agreement will become effective upon your
acceptance of the modified Agreement (except changes required by law which will be effective
immediately) or 15 days after the posting of the notification if you continue to use the Web Store
services.

You may terminate this agreement within the notice period in this section. Termination pursuant to
this section will become effective 15 days after such notification.

## 15\. General Legal Terms {: #legal }

15.1 This Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and governs your
use of the Web Store, and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and Google in
relation to the Web Store. The Google Chrome Web Store Developer Agreement, Google Chrome Web Store
Program Policies, and Google Terms of Service shall take precedence in that order in the event of a
conflict between them, to the extent of such conflict.

15.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is
contained in this Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will
not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that those rights or remedies will still
be available to Google.

15.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision
of this Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from this Agreement without
affecting the rest of this Agreement. The remaining provisions of this Agreement will continue to be
valid and enforceable.

15.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is the
parent shall be third party beneficiaries to this Agreement and that such other companies shall be
entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of this Agreement that confers a benefit
on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be third party
beneficiaries to this Agreement.

15.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. Products available on the Web Store may be subject to export controls or
restrictions by the United States or other countries or territories. You agree to comply with all
applicable U.S. and international export laws and regulations. These laws include restrictions on
destinations, end users, and end use.

15.6 The rights granted in this Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by either you or Google
without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor Google shall be permitted to
delegate their responsibilities or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written
approval of the other party.

15.7 This Agreement, and your relationship with Google under this Agreement, shall be governed by
the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and
Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of
Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising from this Agreement. Notwithstanding
this, you agree that Google shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an
equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.

15.8 The obligations in Sections 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, and 15 will survive any expiration or
termination of this Agreement.
