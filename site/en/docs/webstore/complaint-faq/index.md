Please refer to the following FAQs for information on the complaint handling process for the Chrome
Web Store.

## How can I raise concerns about the Chrome Web Store or Chrome extensions? {: #how-can-i-raise-concerns-about-the-chrome-web-store-or-chrome-extensions }

You can raise concerns with Google about Chrome Web Store and Chrome extensions in three ways:

- Extension take downs: You may have received an email notification about your extension being taken
  down. You can reply to this email to receive further clarification or to appeal the decision..
- Account removals: You may have received an email notification about your account being removed.
  The email includes a link to a support form; you can use the form to receive further
  clarifications or to appeal the removal decision.
- General concerns: For all other concerns, including technical, payment, and questions about terms
  and policies, contact Google through the form linked in the [Chrome Web Store FAQs][cwsfaq-support].

## How can I as a developer in the EU raise concerns related to the Platform To Business (P2B) regulations in Europe? {: #how-can-i-as-a-developer-in-the-eu-raise-concerns-related-to-the-platform-to-business-p2b-regulations-in-europe }

You can file concerns through the general form linked to in the [Chrome Web Store FAQs][cwsfaq-p2b].

## Can I raise concerns to the team through the various online forums? {: #can-i-raise-concerns-to-the-team-through-the-various-online-forums }

The team monitors and responds to various online forums where Chrome extensions are discussed. While
the team occasionally fields questions about specific extensions or developer concerns, the forums
are primarily geared towards discussions about Chrome extensions generally and not intended to be
support channels.

## What is the process for appealing extension take downs or rejections? {: #what-is-the-process-for-appealing-extension-take-downs-or-rejections }

If your extension has been determined to violate one or more terms or policies, you will receive an
email notification. The email contains a description of the specific violation and provides
instructions on next steps. You may request further clarification on the reasons for the take down
or appeal the decision if the developer disagrees. You may reply to the email notifications, and a
team of reviewers will respond with further information.

If after receiving further information or disagreeing with the decision on appeal, and if you are a
business user based in the EU or the UK, you may also apply to resolve a dispute with mediation.
Find more details about the mediators we're willing to engage with and instructions about how to
request mediation at https://support.google.com/legal/answer/9845782. Except as required by
applicable law, mediation is voluntary and neither you nor Google are obliged to settle disputes
through mediation.

## What is the process for appealing account removals? {: #what-is-the-process-for-appealing-account-removals }

You can fill out the form linked in the body of the account removal email in order to receive
further clarifications or to appeal the removal decision. Within seven days, the review team will
respond with further clarification or provide a decision to any appeal requests.

If after receiving further information or disagreeing with the decision on appeal, and if you are a
business user based in the EU or the UK, you may also apply to resolve a dispute with mediation. See
above for more details.

## What types of concerns take longer than seven days to answer? {: #what-types-of-concerns-take-longer-than-seven-days-to-answer }

When a concern must be escalated, response times can depend on the complexity of the issue and the
level of investigation needed to determine the root cause/explanation. For example, issues with
stats on the dashboard, extensions between developers, and developer account recovery have been
known to require longer investigation times.
