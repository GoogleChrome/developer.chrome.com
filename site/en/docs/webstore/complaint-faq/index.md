Please refer to the following FAQs for information on the complaint handling process for the Chrome
Web Store.

## How can I raise concerns about the Chrome Web Store or Chrome extensions? {: #how-can-i-raise-concerns-about-the-chrome-web-store-or-chrome-extensions }

You can use the [CWS Support form][cws-support-form] to raise concerns with Google regarding:

- **Extension take downs:** You may have received an email notification about your extension being
  taken down. You can request further clarification or to appeal the decision.
- **Account removals:** You may have received an email notification about your account being
  removed. If you believe your developer account was wrongly terminated, you can request further clarifications or to appeal the removal
  decision.
- **General concerns:** You can also contact Google for all other concerns, account transfers,
  technical support, developer dashboard issues, or any questions about terms and policies.

## How can I as a developer in the EU raise concerns related to the Platform To Business (P2B) regulations in Europe? {: #how-can-i-as-a-developer-in-the-eu-raise-concerns-related-to-the-platform-to-business-p2b-regulations-in-europe }

You can file concerns through the general [CWS Support form][cws-support-form].

## Can I raise concerns to the team through the various online forums? {: #can-i-raise-concerns-to-the-team-through-the-various-online-forums }

The team monitors and responds to various online forums where Chrome extensions are discussed. These
forums are primarily geared towards discussions about Chrome extension development and not intended
to be support channels. Use the [CWS Support form][cws-support-form] to raise any concerns.

## What is the process for appealing extension take downs or rejections? {: #what-is-the-process-for-appealing-extension-take-downs-or-rejections }

If your extension has been determined to violate one or more terms or policies, you will receive an
email notification. The email contains a description of the specific violation and provides
instructions on next steps. You may request further clarification on the reasons for the take down
or appeal the decision using the [CWS Support form][cws-support-form].

If after receiving further information or disagreeing with the decision on appeal, and if you are a
business user based in the EU or the UK, you may also apply to resolve a dispute with mediation.
Find more details about the mediators we're willing to engage with and instructions about how to
request mediation at https://support.google.com/legal/answer/9845782. Except as required by
applicable law, mediation is voluntary and neither you nor Google are obliged to settle disputes
through mediation.

## What is the process for appealing account removals? {: #what-is-the-process-for-appealing-account-removals }

You can fill out the [CWS Support form][cws-support-form] to receive further clarifications
or to appeal the removal decision. Within **seven days**, the review team will respond with further
clarification or provide a decision to any appeal requests. The CWS will only reinstate accounts if
an error was made, and a re-review finds that your account does not violate the [developer
terms][program-policies].

If after receiving further information or disagreeing with the decision on appeal, and if you are a
business user based in the EU or the UK, you may also apply to resolve a dispute with mediation. See
above for more details.

## What types of concerns take longer than seven days to answer? {: #what-types-of-concerns-take-longer-than-seven-days-to-answer }

When a concern must be escalated, response times can depend on the complexity of the issue and the
level of investigation needed to determine the root cause/explanation. For example, issues with
stats on the dashboard, extensions between developers, and developer account recovery have been
known to require longer investigation times.
