description: Guidelines about how the Chrome Web Store rates the maturity of content.
---

Content ratings help users determine whether your extension and its content are mature in nature.
Ratings are not intended to reflect the quality or complexity of your extension.

As the developer, you are ultimately responsible for rating your extension appropriately. Use the
following rules as guidance in determining whether your extension should be rated "Mature." When
determining your extension's rating, consider all the content in your extension, including user
generated content and ads, and content that your extension links to.

{% Aside 'caution' %}

Regardless of the rating you give your extension, all extensions must still adhere to the terms of the Chrome Web Store's [Fostering a Safe Ecosystem][safe-ecosystem] and the Chrome Web Store [Developer Agreement][developer-agreement].

{% endAside %}

## Sexual and suggestive content

Extensions that focus on sexual content or sexually suggestive content should be rated "Mature." For
example, an extension that is a collection of images of men or women in lingerie posing suggestively
should be rated "Mature." Note that pornography and sexually explicit content are not allowed in the
Chrome Web Store.

As you consider how to rate your extension, here is more guidance on extensions that we would
consider to be sexually explicit, mature, and not mature.

      <th>Not mature</th>
      <th>Mature</th>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Images of people kissing and hugging</li>
          <li>Dating extension that is not focused on sexual relations</li>
          <li>Extension to help a woman choose the right bra size</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Extensions with sexual themes like adult "Truth or Dare" extensions</li>
          <li>Sex position extension with no porn, but has detailed descriptions</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Extensions containing images or videos with nudity or sex acts</li>
          <li>Extensions that contain prominent links to porn sites</li>
        </ul>

## Strong language

Extensions that contain explicit or frequent use of profanity should be rated "Mature."

## Violence

Graphic cartoon or fantasy violence should be rated "Mature." For example, games that depict graphic
violence like decapitations or close-ups of wounds should be rated "Mature." Gratuitous real
violence is not allowed in the Chrome Web Store.

## Alcohol, tobacco and drugs

Extensions that focus on the consumption or sale of drugs, alcohol or tobacco should be rated
"Mature." For example, a game where the main character is a drug dealer should be rated "Mature."
Illegal activity or alcohol, tobacco, or drug content that is targeted at minors is not allowed in
the Chrome Web Store.
