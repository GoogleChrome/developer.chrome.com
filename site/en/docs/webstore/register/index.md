description: How to register as a Chrome Web Store developer.
---

Before you can publish items on the Chrome Web Store, you must register as a CWS developer and pay a
one-time registration fee. You must provide a developer email when you create your developer
account; here are some tips about which email to use:

* It's a good idea to decouple your personal account and your Chrome Web Store publishing account.
  That's why we suggest using a new email account just for publishing your Chrome Web Store items.
* If you recently deleted your Chrome Web Store developer account, you can't reuse its associated
  email identity to create a new one.

  If you requested the deletion of your account by mistake, please contact developer support
  immediately.
  {% endAside %}
* Make sure to check this address frequently so that you're aware of any important alerts or
  announcements.



To register, just access the [developer console][1]. The first time you do this, a registration
screen appears as shown here:

       alt="Screenshot of the Chrome Web Store developer registration page", height="678", width="800" %}

Once you pay the registration fee and agree to the terms, you will not see this registration page
again.
