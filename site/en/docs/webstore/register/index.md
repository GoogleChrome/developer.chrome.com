description: How to register as a Chrome Web Store developer.

Before you can publish items on the Chrome Web Store, you must register as a CWS developer and pay a
one-time registration fee.

<div class="aside aside--note">We suggest using a new account just for your app instead of your personal account.</div>

To register, just access the [developer console][1]. The first time you do this, a registration
screen appears as shown here:

{% Img src="image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/adH2VFqS92VdzPTjsHtB.png", 
       alt="Screenshot of the Chrome Web Store developer registration page", height="678", width="800" %}

Once you pay the registration fee and agree to the terms, you will not see this registration page
again.

<div class="aside aside--note"><strong>Group publishers</strong> note that only members of the group who've paid the registration fee can publish updates.</div>
