description: How to register as a Chrome Web Store developer.
---

Before you can publish items on the Chrome Web Store, you must register as a CWS developer and pay a
one-time registration fee. You must provide a developer email when you create your developer
account; here are some tips about which email to use:

* Because you will receive important emails about your extension or you may want to delete one of your accounts, we suggest using a new email account just for publishing your Chrome Web Store items. 
* Make sure to check this address frequently so that you're aware of any important alerts or
  announcements.
* If you recently [deleted your Chrome Web Store developer account][1], you can't reuse its associated
  email identity to create a new one.

  If you requested the deletion of your account by mistake, please [contact developer support][2]
  immediately.
  {% endAside %}

To register, just access the [developer console][3]. The first time you do this, the following registration screen will appear. First agree to the developer agreement and policies then pay the registration fee.

Once you pay the registration fee and agree to the terms, you will not see this registration page again.
