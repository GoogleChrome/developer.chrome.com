<div class="aside aside--caution"><b>Important:</b> Chrome will be removing support for Chrome Apps on Windows, Mac, and Linux. Chrome OS will continue to support Chrome Apps. Additionally, Chrome and the Web Store will continue to support extensions on all platforms. <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2016/08/from-chrome-apps-to-web.html">Read the announcement</a> and learn more about <a href="/apps/migration">migrating your app</a>.</div>

You can use a [Payments Merchant Account][3] and the Chrome Web Store API to sell virtual goods
within your Chrome App or Chrome Extension.

The [Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard][4] makes it easy to easy to create and manage virtual
goods. You can provide localized descriptions for each product and offer items in local currencies.
It also can help you to verify and manage licenses for the virtual goods purchased by each user.

In order to sell virtual goods, you'll need to:

1.  Create a [Google Payments Merchant account][5].
2.  Create the items you wish to sell via the Developer Dashboard in the Chrome Web Store.
3.  Include the appropriate [`buy.js`][6] file in your package.
4.  Wire up the sales flow.

The [`buy.js`][7] file provides four functions:

[`google.payments.inapp.getSkuDetails`][8]

: Returns an array of active items provided by your product from the Chrome Web Store. Maps to the Web
  Store API [In-App Products List Method][9].

[`google.payments.inapp.buy`][10]

: Purchases an item.

[`google.payments.inapp.getPurchases`][11]

: Returns an array of items purchased by the user. Maps to the Web Store API [Payments List
Method][12].

[`google.payments.inapp.consumePurchase`][13]

: Consumes an item.

<div class="aside aside--note"><b>Note</b>: See <a href="/webstore/pricing">Payments: Regions, fees and tiers</a> for more information about fees and locations where you can sell your virtual goods.</div>

## Purchase flow {: #purchase-flow }

You can use `google.payments.inapp.getSkuDetails` to get the list of available products, and then
show those to the user.

{% img src="image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/EZULNCIw4clveEnCqfvT.png",
       alt="A screenshot of an example purchase flow.", height="566", width="800" %}

<div class="aside aside--note"><strong>Best Practice:</strong> Before showing the user all of the items that are available, compare the list of items that they've already purchased (using <code>google.payments.inapp.getPurchases</code>) and provide some indication that the items have already been purchased.</div>

When a customer clicks a **Purchase** button within your Chrome App or Extension, Chrome uses the
Google account of the user signed into Chrome to display the Google payment processing window.

When the user clicks the **Accept and Buy** button in the payment processing window, the Google
payment server processes the payment and displays a purchase confirmation dialog to the user. The
`success` or `failure` callback is invoked appropriately.

Items uploaded to the Web Store are unable to be purchased through the same developer account.
Instead, use a trusted tester account to run a trial purchase flow.

<div class="aside aside--note"><b>Note</b>: if the user doesn't have a Google account, they are taken through the sign-up flow.</div>

## Using the Chrome Web Store API for In-App Purchases {: #how-to-use }

The Chrome Web Store (CWS) API can be used to handle in-app purchases without the use of any
server-side coding as was previously required by the deprecated Google Wallets for Digital Goods
API.

- The Chrome Web Store handles the list of virtual goods available for sale, eliminating the need to
  create, store, or manage JSON Web Tokens.
- You can get the list of available virtual goods through the `getSkuDetails` function.
- You must include the [`buy.js`][15] library with your package, and load the library from its
  location in your package.
- You must call the `buy()` method with an extra parameter called `parameters`.
- The UI to process payments is displayed in a separate window, rather than in an iframe.
- The Chrome Web Store manages the list of purchased virtual goods (licenses) for each user and
  exposes that list to you through the `getPurchases()` function.

### Setting up your account {: #setup-account }

In order to use the Chrome Web Store API to handle in-app purchases, you'll need to create a [Google
Payments Merchant account][16].

Once you've created the Merchant account, it will be automatically associated with your Chrome App
or Extension listing in the Chrome Web Store.

### Creating and Managing your virtual goods {: #create-digital-goods }

Before you can sell any virtual goods, you need to create the list of in-app products that are
available for purchase. The Chrome Web Store simplifies this process for us by providing an
interface for creating in-app products and licenses. This interface can be found in the In-app
Products tab in the Chrome app listing page of the Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard. Once you
have created your in-app products, you can continue to use this interface to manage them.

{% img src="image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/BboETdjxoq0zsejDhhkL.png",
       alt="A screenshot of the in-app product dashboard", height="614", width="800" %}

1.  Open the [Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard][17] and edit the listing for your app.
2.  Switch to the **In-app Products** tab at the top of the page.
3.  Click **Add new product**.
4.  Provide the necessary information:

    Product ID

    : An identifier (SKU) you'll use to identify that specific product. Product IDs must start with a
      lowercase letter or number and can only contain lowercase letters(a-z), numbers(0-9), dots(.)
      and underscores(\_).

    Title

    : A friendly name of your product that will be shown to users on the purchase confirmation page.

    Description

    : A short description of the item that will be shown to users on the purchase confirmation page.

5.  Choose the price tier or create a custom price within the tier range that you wish to sell the
    item for.
6.  Click **Save** to save the item.
7.  Activate by changing the state to **Active**.

If you want to prepare digital goods for release on a specific day, you can leave the state set to
`Inactive` until you're ready to make those available. This means you can launch new features or
levels, but keep them hidden until you're ready.

- You can have up to 100 items (active, inactive, or archived) at any given time.
- You should move older items that are no longer for sale to archived.
- Be careful when deleting items as users may already have purchased them and may lose their
  license.
- Once a product ID has been used, it cannot be used again, even if it has been deleted.

#### Querying available items {: #query-items }

The `getSkuDetails` function returns a list of all active virtual goods available from the Chrome
Web Store available for purchase by the user, including the product ID (SKU), title, description,
and price. You can provide an optional SKU argument to the function, which will then return only the
details for that specific item.

```js
google.payments.inapp.getSkuDetails({
  'parameters': {'env': 'prod'},
  'success': onSkuDetails,
  'failure': onSkuDetailsFail
});
```

<div class="aside aside--note"><b>Note</b>: The parameters field is required and must be set to <code>{'env': 'prod'}</code> to tell Chrome to use the production instance of the API. Review the <a href="payments-iap#testing">Testing your app</a> section for details on how to test your app without incurring a charge. You can learn about adding trusted testers when you <a href="/webstore/publish#testaccounts">publish your app here</a>.</div>

The response will look like:

```json
{
  "response": {
    "details": {
      "kind": "chromewebstore#inAppProductList",
      "inAppProducts": [
        {
          "kind": "chromewebstore#inAppProduct",
          "sku": "70darkchocolate",
          "item_id": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
          "type": "inapp",
          "state": "ACTIVE",
          "prices": [
            {
              "valueMicros": "990000",
              "currencyCode": "USD",
              "regionCode": "US"
            }
          ],
          "localeData": [
            {
              "title": "Dark Chocolate (70%)",
              "description": "The best chocolate available.",
              "languageCode": "all"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          ...
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

<div class="aside aside--note">You can find the full description of In-App Products Representation and Methods in the <a href="/webstore/webstore_api/inAppProducts#resource">Web Store API Reference</a>.</div>

For example, you might want to list the details of each object you get back from the function:

```js
function onSkuDetails(skus) {
  var products = response.response.details.inAppProducts;
  var count = products.length;
  for (var i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    addProductToUI(products[i]);
  }
}
```

#### Responding to a purchase request {: #respond-to-purchase }

The following code snippet shows how to initiate the purchase flow for an item managed through the
Chrome Web Store:

```js
var sku = "giant_tv";
google.payments.inapp.buy({
  'parameters': {'env': 'prod'},
  'sku': sku,
  'success': onPurchase,
  'failure': onPurchaseFail
});
```

When the purchase completes, Chrome will call the defined callback with the a parameter that looks
like:

```json
{
  "jwt": "eyJhb...0oFuU",
  "request": {
    "cartId": "00000000000000000000.0000000000000000000"
  },
  "response": {
    "orderId": "00000000000000000000.0000000000000000000"
  }
}
```

#### Verifying what items the user has purchased {: #get-purchases }

If you want to verify that the user has purchased an item and has a current license, you can call
`google.payments.inapp.getPurchases`. The function will always return the most up to date
information, and will reflect if the purchase was cancelled by the user, or refunded through the
[Payments Merchant console][21].

```js
google.payments.inapp.getPurchases({
  'parameters': {'env': 'prod'},
  'success': onLicenseUpdate,
  'failure': onLicenseUpdateFail
});
```

The Chrome Web Store will return the list of SKUs that the user has purchased:

```json
{
  "response": {
    "details": [
      {
        "kind": "chromewebstore#payment",
        "itemId": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
        "sku": "giant_tv",
        "createdTime": "1387221267248",
        "state": "ACTIVE"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

<div class="aside aside--note"><b>Note</b>: See the <a href="webstore/webstore_api/payments/list">Web Store API Reference</a> for more details on the payment methods.</div>

```js
function onLicenseUpdate(licenses) {
  var licenses = response.response.details;
  var count = licenses.length;
  for (var i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    var license = licenses[i];
    saveLicense(license);pay
  }
}
```

#### Consume purchased item {: #consume-purchase }

If you want to consume an item that a user has purchased, so that the user can purchase again, you
can call `google.payments.inapp.consumePurchase`. The function will change the license status from
"active" to "cancelled_by_developer".

```js
google.payments.inapp.consumePurchase({
  'parameters': {'env': 'prod'},
  'sku': sku,
  'success': onConsume,
  'failure': onConsumeFail
});
```

After consuming a license, if you make a `getPurchase` call, you'll get:

```json
{
  "response": {
    "details": [
      {
        "kind":"chromewebstore#payment",
        "itemId":"bgjmpalnjpigmmelcdiakkfofbofhege",
        "sku":"bullet",
        "createdTime":"1424800615789",
        "state":"CANCELLED_BY_DEVELOPER"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

<div class="aside aside--note"><b>Note</b>: The <code>consumePurchase</code> API won't work with in-app subscriptions.</div>

## Subscriptions {: #subscription }

Developers can also offer in-app subscriptions.

If a free trial is specified, users will go through the purchase flow for a 0 amount, and the first
recurring order will occur automatically as soon as the free trial period expires. Note that once a
subscription item is activated, developers can no longer inactivate it or change the price or
period. However, the free trial period can be changed at any time. While non-subscription items will
have the type "inapp", subscription items will have the type "subs". For example, getSkuDetails will
return a result for a subscription item that resembles:

```json
{
"kind":"chromewebstore#inAppProduct",
"sku":"banana",
"item_id":"bgjmpalnjpigmmelcdiakkfofbofhege",
"type":"subs",
"state":"ACTIVE",
"prices":[{"valueMicros":"990000","currencyCode":"USD","regionCode":"US"}],"localeData":[{"title":"Bullet","description":"a bullet","languageCode":"en-US"}
```

## Testing purchases {: #testing }

Prior to publishing your app to the world, you can test the In-App Payment experience by publishing
it only to **trusted testers**. When your app is published to trusted testers, the purchase flow
will proceed normally, except they will not be charged.

## Sample Chrome App {: #sample-app }

For a simple app that demonstrates how to use CWS API for in-app products, you can download the
[source code][23] here.

Note, this app is not published in the Chrome Web Store to prevent accidental purchases.
