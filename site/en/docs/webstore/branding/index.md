{% Aside 'warning' %}
**Important:** Chrome will be removing support for Chrome Apps on Windows, Mac, and Linux. Chrome OS
will continue to support Chrome Apps. Additionally, Chrome and the Web Store will continue to
support extensions on all platforms. [Read the announcement][1] and learn more about [migrating your

[Developer Agreement][6]

This page sets forth the guidelines for use of [Google trademarks][7] you should consider when
naming and describing your application. Your use of any Google trademarks is always subject to the
[Google Permissions][8].

## Using the Chrome Web Store badge

You can let others know that your app, extension or theme is available in the Chrome Web Store by
using the "Available in the Chrome Web Store" badge on your site. You do not need pre-approval to
use this badge. However, be sure that your use of the badge is consistent with the Chrome Web Store
[terms of service][6] and these branding guidelines, or we may request that you modify or cease your
use of the badge.

As the following images show, the badge has an optional border.

{% Img src="image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/RQMv2HZ0v6NKfFn7XCeU.png",
       alt="206x58 Chrome Web Store badge, no border",
       height="58", width="206" %}

{% Img src="image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/LclHxMxqoswLNRcUW3m5.png",
       alt="206x58 Chrome Web Store badge, with border", height="58", width="206" %}

Right-click any of the following links to download an image file for the badge.

| Badge for white backgrounds | Badge (with border) for colored backgrounds |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| [small PNG][10] | [small PNG (with border)][14] |
| [medium PNG][11] | [medium PNG (with border)][15] |
| [large PNG][12] | [large PNG (with border)][16] |
| [Adobe Illustrator][13] | [Adobe Illustrator (with border)][17] |

If you resize the badge, preserve the ratio of dimensions, and make sure the badge is legible and
fully visible.

When using the "Available in the Chrome Web Store" badge in marketing executions or on your site,
follow these rules and restrictions:

- Don't modify the badge in any way, other than resizing.
- Don't make the badge the primary element on your page.
- Keep some distance between the badge and other logos and icons on your page.
- Don't use the badge on a page that contains or displays adult content, promotes gambling, promotes
  violence, contains hate speech, involves the sale of tobacco or alcohol to persons under
  twenty-one years of age, violates other applicable laws or regulations or is otherwise
  objectionable.
- Make sure that clicking the badge always links to your page in the Chrome Web Store, and that your
  app, extension or theme is available in the store at all times that you use the badge.

## Choosing an application or developer name

Don't use any Google trademarks or any confusingly similar marks as the name of your application or
company without [written permission from Google.][19]

       alt="Trademark violation", height="146", width="146" %}

{% Img src="image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/2C4YaKrZ3xqIocu0glTV.png",
       alt="Trademark violation", height="146", width="146" %}

{% Img src="image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/TXSCGhobjl0bfUdt8DJK.png",
       alt="Trademark violation", height="146", width="146" %}

## Using Google logos

Don't use Google trademarks or a modified version of a Google trademark as the logo for your
application without written permission from Google. Feel free to continue using our badges in your
application subject to the branding guidelines for each of those badges (for example, [YouTube][20],
[Google Checkout][21]).

{% Img src="image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/l1QxerNZuBZBa6dUFOIT.png",
       alt="Google logo violation", height="146", width="146" %}

{% Img src="image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/e5R2FGF0ZlqmT7Nxg6Ew.png",
       alt="Google logo violation", height="146", width="146" %}

{% Img src="image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/rPqMdiBSYbH6lj1Na2E1.png",
       alt="Acceptable logo", height="146", width="224" %}

## Describing your application

If your product is compatible with a Google product, make reference to that Google product by using
the text "for", "for use with", or "compatible with", and be sure to include the ™ symbol with the
Google trademark. Example: "for Google Chrome™"

{% Img src="image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/KZSasHWcKsgBbhYvXc9H.png",
       alt="Google compatible product logo", height="152", width="392" %}

{% Img src="image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/l0a4lhaR5uN28BOtnnKN.png",
       alt="Google compatible product logo", height="150", width="590" %}

If you are making reference to a Google trademark in combination with your logo, the referencing
text should be smaller in size than your logo.

{% Img src="image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/MEkrcGvgRMGi9dnyB1qI.png",
       alt="Acceptable Google trademark in logo", height="164", width="320" %}

{% Img src="image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/xt1E8oSP6BCexzpaEknR.png",
       alt="Unacceptable Google trademark in logo", height="164", width="250" %}

## Using screenshots

For illustrative or informative purposes, you may use standard, unaltered screenshots of Google
services. For further details, check out the [Google Permissions][8] page.

## Giving proper attribution

Do give proper attribution to Google for any use of their marks in your application title or in your
description. Example:

```text
Android is a trademark of Google Inc.
Use of this trademark is subject to Google Permissions.
