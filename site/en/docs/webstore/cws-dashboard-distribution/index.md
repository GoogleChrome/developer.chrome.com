  to control how you charge for your Chrome Web Store item.
---

The pricing and distribution tab lets you control how you charge for your item and who will see it
on the Chrome Web Store.

## Setting the visibility {: #setting-the-visibility }

Use the **Visibility** settings to configure who can see your item in the Chrome Web Store:

- **Public** — This option lists your item on the Chrome Web Store for all users to see and install.
- **Unlisted** — This option does not create a listing on the Chrome Web Store, but does allows
  anyone to install your item if they know its Chrome Web Store URL.
- **Private** — This option limits installation of your item to specified users only. This is
  typically used for testing before public launch of an item.

### Private visibility: Trusted testers {: #private-visibility-trusted-testers }

Private allows your trusted testers to install the item. You designate trusted testers by listing
them on your Chrome Web Store account home page.

The trusted testers list is associated with your _account_, and not an individual item. To create
multiple trusted tester accounts, you must use separate accounts. However, you can also [add
groups][1]to your private listing, on a per-item basis.

The following screenshot shows some trusted tester accounts listed in a Chrome Web Store developer
account page:

### Private visibility: Google Groups {: #private-visibility-google-groups }

In addition to your trusted tester accounts, you can also include any Google Groups that you own or
manage:

       alt="Screenshot showing groups added to private visibility", height="520", width="800" %}

Any members of the specified groups, along with your trusted testers, will be able to install the
item.

## Setting the geographic distribution {: #setting-the-geographic-distribution }

The **Distribution** setting lets you specify which geographic areas will see your item listing in
the Chrome Web Store. You can either:

- Select **All regions** to display your item to the entire world.
- Select individual countries to publish to — this is useful for items with a regional focus or
  relevance.

When you publish to the world, your item will be immediately visible to the region(s) you select,
and it'll be visible in the store's search results.
