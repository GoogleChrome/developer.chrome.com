  How to add an existing web app to the Chrome Web Store.
---

Got a web app? Follow this tutorial to add your existing web app to the Chrome Web Store.

If you don't already have a web app, you can still follow this tutorial with any other website you
own. Any website can be an installable web app, although the site should follow a few [design
principles][1].

!!!.aside.aside--note
If you're interested in developing a [Chrome Extension][2] or [Chrome App][3] instead of a
web app, follow the [extension tutorial][4] or the [Chrome App tutorial][5]. Then return to this
page, and start at [Step 5: Zip up your app][6].
!!!

## Step 1: Get ready

Before you start, choose your web app and make sure that you can verify your ownership of its site.
Also, note the location of the [Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard][7].

1.  Choose the web app that you want to publish, making a note of its homepage URL and any other
    URLs that it includes.

    Don't have a web app? For the purposes of this tutorial, you can [create a blog][8] on Blogger
    and treat it like an app. Why Blogger? Because it automatically registers you as the owner of
    the blog's subdomain, which makes publishing your app a bit easier.

2.  Make sure that you'll be able to prove ownership of the site that hosts your web app. (Don't
    worry about this if you created a Blogger blog; you already own it.) For information about
    claiming ownership, see the Google Webmaster Tools help article [Adding a site][9].

    !!!.aside.aside--note
    You can wait to actually verify ownership until just before you publish the app.
    !!!

3.  Bookmark the [Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard][10].

## Step 2: Create a manifest file

Every app needs a manifest—a JSON-formatted file named `manifest.json` that describes the app.

1.  Create a directory called `myapp` to contain your app's manifest.

    !!!.aside.aside--note
    You can use a different directory name, if you like. The only name that can't change
    is `manifest.json`.
    !!!

2.  In this new directory, create a text file named `manifest.json` and copy the following code into
    it, changing the italicized text to reflect your app:

    ```json
    {
      "name": "Great App Name",
      "description": "Pithy description (132 characters or less, no HTML)",
      "version": "0.0.0.1",
      "manifest_version": 2,
      "icons": {
        "128": "icon_128.png"
      },
      "app": {
        "urls": [
          "http://mysubdomain.example.com/"
        ],
        "launch": {
          "web_url": "http://mysubdomain.example.com/"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

All new apps must specify manifest version 2 without quotes (see [manifest version
documentation][12]). The remaining fields are fairly straightforward, except for `"urls"` and
`"web_url"`. In this example, those fields have the same values but mean different things.

* `"web_url"`: Specifies the page that the browser shows when a user launches the app.
* `"urls"`: Specifies the starting URLs of all other web pages that are in the app. In this example, both
  http://mysubdomain.example.com/<strong>page1.html</strong> and
  http://mysubdomain.example.com/<strong>subdir/page2.html</strong> would be in the app. You don't need to
  specify the URLs for included files or for assets such as images. Currently, the domain name must be
  followed by at least one character ("/").

!!!.aside.aside--note
If your app has only one page, you can omit the "urls" field.
!!!

For more information about what the manifest for a hosted app can contain, see [Hosted Apps][13].

## Step 3: Get images

Your app needs an icon, plus at least one screenshot and one promotional image. The icon is used in
the New Tab page and may also be used in the store; the screenshot is used in the store's listing
for your app; the promotional image is used on the store's main page and in other places where the
store presents multiple apps.

1.  Create or find an icon that follows the guidelines in the [App icon][15] section of Supplying
    Images.
2.  Put the icon in the `myapp` directory, with the name `icon_128.png`.
3.  Take at least one screenshot of your app, following the guidelines in the [Screenshots][16]
    section of Supplying Images.
4.  Edit each screenshot to be 1280x800 or 640x400 pixels. Larger screenshots look better on
    high-resolution displays.
5.  Create at least one promotional image. It must be 440x280 and follow the guidelines in the
    [Promotional images][17] section of Supplying Images. You can also provide 920x680 and 1400x560
    promotional images.

    !!!.aside.aside--note
    Promotional images are the main way that people will notice your app. Make them pretty
    and informative!
    !!!

!!!.aside.aside--note
If you don't have an icon yet, you can continue with this tutorial by temporarily removing
the following lines from the `manifest.json` file: `"icons": { "128": "_icon_128.png_" },`
!!!



## Step 4: Verify that the app works

In this step, you'll load the unpacked app into the browser, so you can confirm that the app is
valid.

1.  Bring up the extensions management page: chrome://extensions.
2.  If **Developer mode** has a + by it, click the +.
    The + changes to a -, and more buttons and information appear.
3.  Click the **Load unpacked extension** button.
    A file dialog appears.
4.  In the file dialog, choose the `myapp` directory.
    Unless you get an error dialog, you've now installed the app.

    !!!.aside.aside--note
    If you get an error dialog saying you could not load the extension, make sure your
    manifest file has valid JSON formatting and is called `manifest.json` (not `manifest.json.txt`
    or `manifest.json.rtf`, for example). You can use a [JSON validator][19] to make sure your
    manifest's format is valid. Often, formatting issues are related to commas (`,`) and quotation
    marks (`"`)—either too many or not enough. For example, the last entry in the manifest should
    not have a comma after it.
    !!!

5.  Create a new tab.
    The icon for the newly installed app appears in Google Chrome's launcher on the New Tab page. If
    the Apps area is minimized, then instead of the icon you specified, you should see the website
    favicon.
6.  Click the icon for the app.
    You've now launched the app. You should see its website in your browser window. If you don't,
    try changing the value of "web_url" in the manifest, reload the app, and click its icon again.

## Step 5: Zip up your app

Create a ZIP archive of the directory that contains `manifest.json` and the icon. On Windows, you
can do this by right-clicking `myapp` and choosing the menu item **Send to > Compressed (zipped)
folder**. On Mac OS X, control-click `myapp` and choose **Compress "myapp"**.

If you like to use the command line, you might enter this:

```text
zip -r myapp.zip myapp
```

!!!.aside.aside--note
If your app is an extension or a packaged app that uses Native Client, you can structure
your application directory hierarchy and ZIP file in a way that reduces the size of the user
download package. For details, see [Reducing the size of the user download package][21].
!!!

## Step 6: Upload your app

In this step, you upload the ZIP file that you created in Step 5.

1.  Decide which Google Account is your **developer account**—the account that you'll use to verify
    ownership and publish your app. Instead of using your personal Gmail account, you might want to
    create a dedicated account for your apps. For details, see [Choose a developer account][23] in
    Publishing Your App.

    !!!.aside.aside--note
    If you created a blog, choose the account that you used to create that blog.
    !!!

2.  Go to the [Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard][24], and sign into your developer account.

    !!!.aside.aside--note
    If you don't have a developer account, then when you try and access the dashboard you'll be
    asked to [register as a Chrome Web Store developer][25] now and pay a one-time fee. If you
    already have a developer account, but have never paid the one-time fee, you'll see the same
    retistration page and will need to pay the one-time fee now.
    !!!

    Once you sign in, you'll see a list of any installable web apps, extensions, and themes that
    you've already uploaded.

3.  Click the **Add new item** button in the dashboard.
    If you've never uploaded an installable web app, extension, or theme before, you need to accept
    the developer agreement before going on.
4.  Click **Choose file**, choose the ZIP file you created in Step 5, and click **Upload**.
    If you see an error message, fix the error, zip up the directory again, and upload the ZIP file.

Within seconds you should see the Edit page for your app. At the top, you might see a warning that
you must verify ownership for whatever sites you specified in the "urls" and "web_url" fields. That
warning has a link that takes you to Google Webmaster Tools, where you can verify ownership at any
time before you publish the app.

## Step 7: Fill out the form, and upload images

In this step, you use the dashboard's Edit page to provide information for the store's listing of
your app.

1.  In the **Detailed description** section, enter text that describes your app.
2.  In the **Icon** section, upload the same 128x128 icon that you put into the ZIP file.
3.  In the **Screenshots** section, upload at least one screenshot of the app (1280x800 or 640x400).
    Four or five would be better.
4.  In the **Promotional images** section, upload your promotional images (you must upload at least
    the 440x280 image).
5.  Under the **Verified website** section, select the website for which the app is an "official
    item". The drop-down lists only the domains for which you're the verified owner.
6.  In the **Categories** section, select at least one category for your app. For more information,
    see [Choose your app's category well][27] in Best Practices.
7.  If you want to charge for your app, specify the price and the payment system in the **Pricing
    and Payments** section. You can use the built-in Chrome Web Store Payments system if you are in
    a [supported region][28]. For more information about payment options, see [Monetizing Your
    App][29].
8.  At the bottom of the edit page, click **Save draft and return to dashboard**.

!!!.aside.aside--note
If you are already hosting your app in Google Play, and you want your Chrome Web Store app
listing to show an "Available for Android" link, your app must have the same name as your Google
Play listing and both apps must be owned by the same developer account. To have your CWS item
transferred to a different developer account, you must submit this [form][30].
!!!

## Step 8: Preview and improve your app's listing

Now you get to see what your app's listing in the store will look like.

1.  In the [dashboard][32], click your app's "Edit" link to return to its Edit page.
2.  At the bottom of the Edit page, click **Preview changes**. You should see a page that looks
    something like this:

    {% img src="image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/DnAipknPku2gPKNyqXpG.png",
           alt="a screenshot of the store listing", height="328", width="550" %}

    !!!.aside.aside--note
    If you haven't provided a screenshot yet, your page will have a big blank space at the
    upper left.
    !!!

3.  Make sure that the images and text look good and that any links you provide are valid. If you
    refer to Google brands, follow the [Branding Guidelines][33].
4.  At the top of the page, click the "Edit" link to return to the Edit page.
5.  After making any improvements you'd like, click **Save draft and return to dashboard**.

!!!.aside.aside--note
Before finalizing your app's listing, think about how users are going to find your app,
and make sure the detailed description includes the terms they're likely to search for. Check out
listings for similar apps to get ideas for how you should present your app.
!!!

## Step 9: Test, deploy, publish, improve, repeat

1.  Test your app to make sure its users will have a good experience with it. If your app uses
    features such as geolocation or notifications that require user consent, consider adding a
    permissions field to the [manifest][35].
2.  If you don't already have a support site, create one. Providing a link to a support site in your
    app's listing gives users an alternative to using the User reviews section as a way of reporting
    issues.
3.  Once your app and the sites it depends on are ready, deploy the app to the web (if it isn't
    already public).
4.  In the [Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard][36], click the "Publish" link to publish your
    app's listing in the Chrome Web Store.

    When you publish your app, its listing becomes visible to you and to anyone who has access to
    the Chrome Web Store. People can buy your app (if you charge) and install it. When they install
    your app, they download a `.crx` file that contains everything you uploaded in the ZIP file.

5.  After you publish your app, whenever you want to change your app's listing or `.crx` file, use
    the dashboard to update them. To push an updated `.crx` file for your app, just increment the
    version number in the manifest, upload a new ZIP file to the dashboard, and publish the change.
    People who have already installed your app will automatically get the update.
