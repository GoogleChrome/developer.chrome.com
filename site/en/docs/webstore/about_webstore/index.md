The [Chrome Web Store][webstore] lets you publish extensions&mdash;either free or paid&mdash;where Google Chrome
users can easily find them. 

Your published item can be free, or you can charge for it using any payment system you like.

To upload and publish items, use the [Chrome Developer Dashboard][dashboard].

## Why should I use the Chrome Web Store?

Publishing your extension in the Chrome Web Store lets you reach more people. You can also earn revenue or
build Chrome-specific features into it.
