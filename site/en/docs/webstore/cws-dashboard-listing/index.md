Add the store listing information for your item that isn't in the ZIP file, such as a long
description, screenshots, videos, and links to related sites. You'll need the following to finish
your item's store listing:

- A **detailed description** of your item. Write your description to entice users to download your
  item. Make sure to start your description with a concise statement of what your item does, so
  users can understand the main idea and features at a glance. Your description can then go on to
  provide more detail, promotional copy, update logs, and so forth.
- At least one 1280x800 or 640x400 **screenshot** or YouTube **video** to show off what your item
  does. These are displayed in your item's Chrome Web Store listing in the following order:
  1.  Any localized video that you provide.
  2.  Any localized screenshots that you provide.
  3.  Any global (non-localized) video.
  4.  Global screenshots.
- A 440x280 **small tile icon** that will be displayed on the Chrome Web Store wall.
- The **primary category** where your item should be listed.
- Your item's **language** to help users find it.

See [Supplying Images][1] for help on designing the images for your item, and [Branding
Guidelines][2] for information on how you can use Google brands.
