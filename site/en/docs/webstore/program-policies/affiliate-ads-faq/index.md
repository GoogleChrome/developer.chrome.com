## What is an affiliate ads violation?

Our developer policy prohibits the inclusion of affiliate ad programs without explicit disclosure to users. This means that affiliate programs must be disclosed in the extension's metadata as well as before installation. 

## What are affiliate ad programs?

Affiliate ad programs are a process where publishers earn a commission by promoting a product or service made by another retailer or advertiser using an affiliate link, code, or cookie. The affiliate partner is rewarded a payout for providing a specific result to the retailer or advertiser.

## What is an affiliate URL?  

A URL that includes an identification option to track conversions and clicks in affiliate marketing is considered an affiliate URL.

## What is an affiliate code?  

Similar to affiliate URLs, affiliate codes are any promo codes, discount codes, or other mechanism to track conversions and clicks in affiliate marketing.

## What is "related user action"?

The user must reasonably expect the inclusion of affiliate codes, URLs, etc. based on their interaction with your extension. For example, related user action could be clicking an advertisement or selecting "apply promo codes" in a pop-up window. Automatically including affiliate codes without any interaction from the user is considered a violation. 

## What is click-bait?

Text, metadata, or other content which is deceptive, sensationalized, or otherwise misleading, and is designed to attract attention and to entice users to install an extension with dubious value, is considered click-bait. For example, a new tab page extension that purports to provide government forms, while only including a small number of forms, or forms that are out of date, would be considered click-bait under this policy. This is because government forms is a highly searched term and the actual value provided by the extension is negligible. 

## Can developers appeal an affiliate ads violation?

You can appeal an affiliate ads violation if you think it was flagged in error. To appeal, see the instructions included in the notification email. This is sent to the email address listed under your Chrome Web Store developer account.
