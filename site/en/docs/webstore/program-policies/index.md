The Chrome Web Store is committed to providing a safe and secure environment for users, built on
trust and transparency. For these reasons, the Chrome Web Store requires all developers to comply
with both the Developer Program Policies listed below, and the Developer Agreement. When your
extension is reviewed by Google, these policies act as a guiding principle for those reviews. These
policies apply to the entire user experience of your application/extension/theme - including any
marketing materials, user generated content, ads, landing pages, etc - unless otherwise noted.

## Chrome Web Store Principles {: #principals }

The Chrome Web Store is a premier platform where users can discover and install extensions that are
high-quality, trusted and safe. Chrome strives to reflect the diversity of its developers and users,
but will robustly curate the products in the Store to ensure a positive experience.  As we enhance
and improve upon the Chrome Web Store experience, we are guided by the following core principles:

<div class="policy-principals">

### Be Safe {: #be-safe }

**We strive to make the Chrome Web Store a safe and trusted environment for developers and users**,
which means that we will remove extensions that pose security threats, access data beyond what is
necessary to implement their functions, appear to take advantage of users, encourage harm or hate
speech, or otherwise abuse the Store system and network.

### Be Honest {: #be-honest }

**Building and maintaining user trust in the Chrome Web Store is paramount, which means we set a
high bar for developer transparency.** All functionalities of extensions should be clearly disclosed
to the user, with no surprises. This means we will remove extensions which appear to deceive or
mislead users, enable dishonest behavior, or utilize clickbaity functionality to artificially grow
their distribution.

### Be Useful {: #be-useful }

**Extensions in the Store must provide experiences that are educational, informative, entertaining,
inclusive, and that result in a positive user experience.** We will remove extensions that appear to
provide little to no utility to users, or do not provide the reasonably expected functionality.
Chrome will also strive to provide useful tools to developers to help encourage innovation.

## Best Practices and Guidelines {: #group-best-practices }

To help ensure the best experience for both users and developers, please review the below guidelines
before submitting your extension to the Chrome Web Store. Following all of these guidelines doesn’t
mean your extension will be automatically approved, but they will help you to avoid common mistakes
that often delay the review process.

</div>
<div class="policy-card policy-card--policies stack">

## Fostering a Safe Ecosystem {: #group-safe-ecosystem }

The Chrome Web Store is committed to providing a safe and secure environment for users. Extensions
which contain objectionable content or place users at risk are strictly prohibited.

* [Mature & Sexually Explicit Material][explicit-material]
* [Malicious and Prohibited Products][malicious-and-prohibited]
* [Hate Speech and Violent Behavior][hate-and-violence]
* [Regulated Goods and Services][regulated-goods-and-services]

</div>
<div class="policy-card policy-card--policies stack">

## Protecting User Privacy {: #group-user-privacy }

We want to make sure users feel confident that the products they find in the Chrome Web Store are
safe, transparent, and prioritize user privacy. Integrating these considerations within your
product's design is critical.

* [Privacy Policies][privacy]
* [Limited Use][limited-use]
* [Use of Permissions][permissions]
* [Disclosure Requirements][disclosure-requirements]
* [Handling Requirements][data-handling]

</div>
<div class="policy-card policy-card--policies stack">

## Ensuring Responsible Marketing and Monetization {: #group-marketing }

Extensions must be marketed responsibly. When developers copy someone else's work or deceive users,
it hurts users and the developer community. Don't rely on misleading behavior or unfair use of other
people's work.

* [Impersonation & Intellectual Property][impersonation-and-intellectual-property]
* [Deceptive Installation Tactics][deceptive-installation-tactics]
* [Accepting Payment from Users][accepting-payment]
* [Misleading or Unexpected Behavior][unexpected-behavior]
* [Ads][ads]

</div>
<div class="policy-card policy-card--policies stack">

## Building Quality Products {: #group-quality }

Developers are critical partners in maintaining a great user experience in the Chrome Web Store.
Your extensions should include features, content, and UI that provide unique value to the Chrome Web
Store. At a minimum, extensions should provide users with a basic degree of functionality and a
respectful user experience. We may reject extensions unless they provide a unique, high-quality
experience. Spamming the store may lead to your removal as a developer from the Chrome web Store.

* [Featured Products][featured-products]
* [Spam & Abuse][spam-and-abuse]
* [Quality Guidelines][quality-guidelines]
* [Listing Requirements][listing-requirements]
* [Minimum Functionality][minimum-functionality]
* [Packaged Apps][chrome-apps]

</div>
<div class="policy-card policy-card--policies stack">

## Technical Requirements {: #group-tech-reqs }

In addition to compliance with the policies set out elsewhere in the Developer Program Policies,
extensions must follow certain technical guidelines to ensure a positive user experience.

* [Code Readability Requirements][code-readability]
* [API Use][api-use]
* [Additional Requirements for Manifest V3][mv3-requirements]
* [Two Step Authentication][two-step-verification]

## Enforcement {: #group-enforcement }

Learn more about how our policies apply, how we enforce our policies, and how you can manage policy
violations.

* [Notifications & Appeals][notification-and-appeals]
* [Repeat Abuse][repeat-abuse]

## Best Practices and Guidelines {: #best-practices }

* Extensions should add value to the Chrome Web Store. If your extension is not particularly useful
  or unique, it doesn’t belong on the Chrome Web Store.

* No cheating. If you attempt to scam the system (for example, by misleading users, circumventing
  enforcement, copying the work of other developers, or manipulating your extension’s reviews or
  ratings) you will be banned from the Chrome Web Store.

* Ensure that all of your extension’s information and metadata are up to date and accurate.

* Test your extensions for crashes, broken features, and bugs prior to submission.

* Verify that your contact information is correct to ensure you receive important communications for
  the Chrome Web Store.

* Include detailed information in the single purpose field regarding your extension’s primary
  functionality.

* Provide meaningful customer support for your extension.
