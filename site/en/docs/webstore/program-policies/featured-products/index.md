The Chrome Web Store features products that align with our standards, values, and that we believe
will produce valuable user experiences. Certain products that don't meet these standards, but which
do not explicitly violate CWS policies - such as VPN extensions and Video Downloaders - may be
restricted from feature in the Store, but will still be available to users. For example, the
following products are currently not featured in the CWS Store:

<ol type="A">
<li>
