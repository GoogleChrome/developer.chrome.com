1. The Chrome Web Store features products that align with our standards, values, and that we believe
   will produce valuable user experiences. Certain products that don't meet these standards, but
   which do not explicitly violate CWS policies - such as VPN extensions and Video Downloaders - may
   be restricted from feature in the Store, but will still be available to users. For example, the
   following products are currently not featured in the CWS Store:

    1. Religious or political content

    1. VPNs

    1. Video Downloaders

    1. Anti-Virus tools

    1. Content deemed not family friendly

    1. Bots

    1. Cryptocurrency

    1. Non-production builds

    1. Prohibited products

    1. Gambling content

    1. Extensions whose developers have questionable reputations, such as historically misleading or
       malicious extensions.
