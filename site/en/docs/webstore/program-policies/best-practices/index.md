1. Extensions should add value to the Chrome Web Store. If your extension is not particularly useful or unique, it doesn’t belong on the Chrome Web Store.

1. No cheating. If you attempt to scam the system (for example, by misleading users, circumventing enforcement, copying the work of other developers, or manipulating your extension’s reviews or ratings) you will be banned from the Chrome Web Store.

1. Ensure that all of your extension’s information and metadata are up to date and accurate.

1. Test your extensions for crashes, broken features, and bugs prior to submission.

1. Verify that your contact information is correct to ensure you receive important communications for the Chrome Web Store.

1. Include detailed information in the single purpose field regarding your extension’s primary functionality.

1. Provide meaningful customer support for your extension.
