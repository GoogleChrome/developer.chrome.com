Keyword Spam is the practice of including irrelevant or excessive keywords in an extensions
description in an attempt to manipulate its ranking, resulting in a spammy, negative user
experience. We don't allow extensions with misleading, improperly formatted, non-descriptive,
irrelevant, excessive, or inappropriate metadata, including but not limited to the extension's
description, developer name, title, icon, screenshots, and promotional images. Developers should
focus on providing a clear and well-written description that uses keywords appropriately and in
context. Some examples of Keyword Spam include:

<ol type="A">
<li>

Lists of sites/brands/keywords without substantial added value

</li>
<li>

Lists of regional locations

</li>
<li>

Unnatural repetition of the same keyword more than 5 times

</li>
</ol>

</li>

We don’t allow unattributed or anonymous user testimonials in the product's description.

</ol>
