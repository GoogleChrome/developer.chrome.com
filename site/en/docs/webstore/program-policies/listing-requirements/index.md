1. If your product has a blank description field or is missing an icon or screenshots, it will be rejected.

1. Keyword Spam is the practice of including irrelevant or excessive keywords in an extensions description in an attempt to manipulate its ranking, resulting in a spammy, negative user experience. We don't allow extensions with misleading, improperly formatted, non-descriptive, irrelevant, excessive, or inappropriate metadata, including but not limited to the extension's description, developer name, title, icon, screenshots, and promotional images. Developers should focus on providing a clear and well-written description that uses keywords appropriately and in context. Some examples of Keyword Spam include:

    1. Lists of sites/brands/keywords without substantial added value

    1. Lists of regional locations

    1. Unnatural repetition of the same keyword more than 5 times

1. We donâ€™t allow unattributed or anonymous user testimonials in the product's description.
