1. Do not post an extension with a single purpose of installing or launching another app, theme, webpage, or extension.

1. Extensions with broken functionality—such as dead sites or non-functioning features—are not allowed.

1. Extensions must provide a basic degree of functionality and utility that provide value to the catalog of the Chrome Web Store. Some examples of common violations include:

     1. Extensions with no functionality or utility.

     1. Extensions with functionality that is not directly provided by the extension (e.g. file converters which only link to other file conversion services).

     1. Click-baity template extensions that only vary slightly in functionality with negligible utility (e.g. a “Word of the Day” extension and a “Daily Inspirational Quotes” extension, which use the same general extension template).
