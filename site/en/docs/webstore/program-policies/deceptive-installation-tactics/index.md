Extensions must be marketed responsibly. The set of functionalities promised by the extension must
be stated clearly and in a transparent manner. The outcome of any user interaction should match the
reasonable expectations that were set with the user. Extensions that use or benefit from deceptive
installation tactics will be removed from the Chrome Web Store. Deceptive installation tactics
include:

<ol type="A">
<li>

Unclear or inconspicuous disclosures on marketing collateral preceding the Chrome Web Store product
listing.

</li>
<li>

Misleading interactive elements as part of your distribution flow. This includes misleading
call-to-action buttons or forms that imply an outcome other than the installation of an extension.

</li>
<li>

Adjusting the Chrome Web Store product listing window with the effect of withholding or hiding
extension metadata from the user.

</li>
<li>

Bundling other extensions or offers within the same installation flow.

</li>
<li>

Requiring unrelated user action to access advertised functionality.

</li>
</ol>
