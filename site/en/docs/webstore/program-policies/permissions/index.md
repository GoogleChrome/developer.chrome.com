Request access to the narrowest permissions necessary to implement your Product's features or
services. If more than one permission could be used to implement a feature, you must request those
with the least access to data or functionality. Don't attempt to "future proof" your Product by
requesting a permission that might benefit services or features that have not yet been implemented.
