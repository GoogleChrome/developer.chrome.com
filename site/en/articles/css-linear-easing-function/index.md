## Easings in CSS

When animating or transitioning elements in CSS, you control the rate at which a value changes with an easing function using the `animation-timing-function` and `transition-timing-function` properties.

There are several keywords available as presets in CSS, namely `linear`, `ease`, `ease-in`, `ease-out`, and `ease-in-out`. To create your own easing curves use the `cubic-bezier()` function, or  take a steps based approach using the `steps()` easing function.

  theme: 'dark',
  tab: 'result'
} %}

{%Aside%}Learn more about these easing keywords and functions in [Learn CSS: Animations](https://web.dev/learn/css/animations#animation_timing_function).{%endAside%}

When used appropriately, easings give an animated element a sense of weight as it appears to gather momentum.

Creating complex curves such as bounce or spring effects is not possible in CSS, but thanks to `linear()` you can now approximate them astonishingly well.

## An intro to `linear()`

{% BrowserCompat 'css.types.easing-function.linear-function' %}

A new way to define an easing in CSS is with `linear()`. This function accepts a number of stops, separated by commas. Each stop is a single number that ranges from 0 to 1. In between each stop the interpolation is done in a linear way, explaining the name of the function.

```css
animation-timing-function: linear(0, 0.25, 1);
```

These stops are by default spread equidistantly. In the preceding snippet, that means the output value of `0.25` will be used at the 50% mark.

Visualized, the graph for `linear(0, 0.25, 1)` looks like this:

{% Img src="image/AeNB0cHNDkYPUYzDuv8gInYA9rY2/gNgoODC3lkqdYcJd0cgV.svg", alt="Chart visualization of linear(0, 0.25, 1).", width="652", height="600" %}

If you don’t want the stops to be spread equidistantly, you can optionally pass in a _stop length_. When passing in one value as a stop length, you define its starting point:

```css
animation-timing-function: linear(0, 0.25 75%, 1);
```

Here, an output value of `0.25` will not be used at the `50%` mark but at `75%`.

{% Img src="image/AeNB0cHNDkYPUYzDuv8gInYA9rY2/eQBNWbcAaXieBbc8y0d6.svg", alt="Chart visualization of linear(0, 0.25 75%, 1).", width="652", height="600" %}

When specifying two values as a stop length, you define both its starting and ending point:

```css
animation-timing-function: linear(0, 0.25 25% 75%, 1);
```

An output value of 0.25 will be used from 25% to 75% in time.

{% Img src="image/AeNB0cHNDkYPUYzDuv8gInYA9rY2/NbWKeK1tt6GiKorRSVsk.svg", alt="Chart visualization of linear(0, 0.25 25% 75%, 1).", width="652", height="600" %}

## Creating complex curves with linear()

While the examples above are very simple easings, you can use `linear()` to recreate complex easing functions in a very simple manner, with the compromise of losing some precision.

Take this bounce easing curve, a type of easing that cannot be expressed directly in CSS, defined using JavaScript:

```js
function easing(pos) {
  const t = 7.5625;
  const e = 2.75;
  return pos < 1 / e
    ? t * pos * pos
    : pos < 2 / e
    ? t * (pos -= 1.5 / e) * pos + 0.75
    : pos < 2.5 / e
    ? t * (pos -= 2.25 / e) * pos + 0.9375
    : t * (pos -= 2.625 / e) * pos + 0.984375;
}
```

While the code might not tell you much, a visualization might. Here’s the output, visualized as a blue curve:

{% Img src="image/AeNB0cHNDkYPUYzDuv8gInYA9rY2/WmozaWB6Zur6JvC62r2C.svg", alt="A smooth bounce curve drawn in blue.", width="600", height="600" %}

The curve can be simplified by adding a number of stops onto it. Here, each green dot indicates a stop:

{% Img src="image/AeNB0cHNDkYPUYzDuv8gInYA9rY2/NDJw6qW68We1xw7Q2E5c.svg", alt="A smooth bounce curve in blue, with green dots laid on top.", width="600", height="600" %}

When passed into `linear()`, the result is a curve that kinda looks like the original one, but is a bit rougher on the edges.

{% Img src="image/AeNB0cHNDkYPUYzDuv8gInYA9rY2/5fjFE8QHzN5Y1PooPik4.svg", alt="A simplified curve in green laid on top of the original smooth curve in blue.", width="600", height="600" %}

Compare the green animated box to the blue one, you can tell it’s not as smooth.

But, if you add enough stops you can approximate the original curve quite well. Here’s an updated version:

{% Img src="image/AeNB0cHNDkYPUYzDuv8gInYA9rY2/sBN3YAierNGLjjOs5cHE.svg", alt="An updated curve, with twice the number of stops.", width="600", height="600" %}

By merely doubling the number of stops, you already get a smooth result.

The code used to animate looks like this:

```css
animation-timing-function: linear(
  /* Start to 1st bounce */
  0, 0.004, 0.016, 0.035, 0.063 9.1%, 0.141, 0.25, 0.391, 0.563, 0.765, 1,
  /* 1st to 2nd bounce */
  0.891, 0.813 45.5%, 0.785, 0.766, 0.754, 0.75, 0.754, 0.766, 0.785, 0.813 63.6%, 0.891, 1 72.7%,
  /* 2nd to 3rd bounce */
  0.973, 0.953, 0.941, 0.938, 0.941, 0.953, 0.973, 1,
  /* 3rd bounce to end */
  0.988, 0.984, 0.988, 1
);
```

## A tool to help

Manually creating this list of stops would be very cumbersome. Thankfully, [Jake](/authors/jakearchibald/) and [Adam](/authors/argyle/) have created [a tool to help you convert an easing curve to its `linear()` counterpart](https://linear-easing-generator.netlify.app/).

<figure>
  {% Img src="image/AeNB0cHNDkYPUYzDuv8gInYA9rY2/7sLDqz722Xgd8Irigwl7.png", alt="Screenshot of the linear easing generator tool.", width="800", height="448" %}
  <figcaption>Screenshot of <a href="https://linear-easing-generator.netlify.app/">https://linear-easing-generator.netlify.app/</a> in action.</figcaption>
</figure>

The tool takes a JavaScript easing function or SVG curve as its input, and outputs the simplified curve using `linear()`. Use the sliders to control the number of stops you want, and their precision.

At the top-right, you can also choose one of the presets: Spring, Bounce, Simple elastic, or Material Design emphasized easing are included.

## DevTools support

Available in DevTools is support to visualize and edit the result of `linear()`. Click on the icon to show an interactive tooltip that lets you drag around the stops.
