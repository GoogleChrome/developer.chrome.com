For over 25 years, `sRGB` (standard red green blue) has been the only color
gamut for CSS gradients and colors, with color space offerings within it like
`rgb()`, `hsl` and hex. It is the most common color gamut capability amongst
displays; a *lowest* common denominator.

As displays become more capable of showing colors, CSS needs a way to access and
specify colors from within these display capabilities or else it will be stuck
in the 90s color ranges forever or forced to never match the wide gamut
offerings found in images and video.
[Trapped](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3Gpk5dbCk), only showing [30% of the
colors the human eye can
see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide-gamut_RGB_color_space), when modern
alternatives offer 70% or more. We can now thank [Color Level
4](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4) for helping us escape this trap.

Shipped in Chrome 110 is support for [CSS Color
4](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/) gamuts and color spaces, joining Safari
which has support for `display-p3` since 2016. CSS can now support HD (high
definition) displays, specifying colors from HD gamuts and offering more color
spaces which have specializations. This guide will explain how you can start to
take advantage of this new world of color.

additional color spaces provide new tools and methods for managing and creating
color systems. HSL has a "lightness" channel, which was the best web developers
had in CSS, until LCH's "perceptual lightness."

In the following example, `50%` lightness in HSL is compared to `50%` in LCH,
across a series of hues. The gray next to each color swatch is the perceived
lightness as defined in LCH. Notice how HSL is wildly inconsistent while LCH remains
constant. This makes HSL a poor color space for doing contrast calculations or
building dynamic color systems.

In supporting browsers, there's 50% more colors to pick from! You thought 16
million colors sounded like a lot, wait until you see how many colors some of
these new spaces can show. Also, think about all those gradients that

enough colors in between your request, that's pacified too.

This guide will cover where color has been, where it is going, and how CSS will
enable and support web developers to manage color.

## Overview

The current problem with color and the web, is that the displays most folks have
in their pockets, laps or mounted on walls are wide gamut, high definition color
ready. CSS on the other hand, is not high definition ready, until now. The color
capability of displays grew faster than CSS, now CSS is here to catch up.

There's much more than just "more colors" too. By the end of this article you'll
be able to specify more colors, enhance gradients, pick the color space and
color gamut for a task they excel at.

### What is a color gamut?

A gamut represents the size of something. The phrase "millions of colors" is a
comment about the gamut of a display, or the range of colors it has to choose
from. In the following image, three gamuts are compared, and the larger the size
the more colors it offers.

{% Img
  src="image/vS06HQ1YTsbMKSFTIPl2iogUQP73/mM8vJ9grbV1ssmaF0rPH.png",
  alt="Color gamuts are compared side by side as a triangle shape.
  sRGB is the smallest and Rec2020 is the largest.",
  width="800",
  height="343"
%}

A color gamut can also have a name. Like a basketball versus a baseball or a
vente coffee cup versus a grande; a name for the size can help people
communicate. Learning these color gamut names helps you communicate and quickly
understand a range of colors.

This article will introduce you to 7 new gamuts, all with wider range than sRGB
and each with its own quarks and features to assist you in a color task:

- [sRGB](#srgb)
- [RGB 98](#a98-rgb)
- [Display p3](#display-p3)
- [Rec2020](#rec2020)
- [ProPhoto](#prophoto-rgb)
- [CIE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIE_1931_color_space)
- [HVS](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/courses/572/colorvis/gamutvis.html) (human visual gamut)

{% Aside %}
Maybe you know which of these gamuts your laptop or TV offers?
{% endAside %}

### What is a color space?

Color spaces are arrangements of a gamut, establishing a shape and a method of
accessing colors. Usually these are 3D shapes, like cubes or cylinders. This
color arrangement determines which colors are next to each other and how
accessing and interpolating colors will work.

RGB is a cube and colors are accessed by specifying 3 coordinates. HSL is a
cylinder and colors are accessed via a hue angle and 2 coordinates.

    src="image/vS06HQ1YTsbMKSFTIPl2iogUQP73/WZGF2UHvtwtQiQSI4H0X.png",

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV</a>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

The level 4 specification introduces 12 new color spaces for looking up colors
from the 7 new gamuts shared previously:

- [sRGB Linear](#linear-srgb)
- [LCH](#lch)
- [okLCH](#oklch)
- [LAB](#lab)
- [okLAB](#oklab)
- [Display p3](#display-p3)
- [Rec2020](#rec2020)
- [a98 RGB](#a98-rgb)
- [ProPhoto RGB](#prophoto-rgb)
- [XYZ](#xyz-xyz-d50-xyz-d65)
- [XYZ d50](#xyz-xyz-d50-xyz-d65)
- [XYZ d65](#xyz-xyz-d50-xyz-d65)

These are in addition to the 4 color spaces previously available:

- [Hex](#hex)
- [RGB](#rgb)
- [HSL](#hsl)
- [HWB](#hwb)

### Color gamut and color space summary

A color space is a mapping of colors where a color gamut is a range of colors.
Consider a color gamut as a total of particles and a color space as a bottle
made to hold that range of particles.

Here's an interactive visual of what I mean. Point, drag and zoom around in this
demo of an RGB cube filled with color particles.

{% Codepen { user: 'web-dot-dev', id: 'gOjrLwm' } %}

Use color gamuts to talk about a range of colors, like low/narrow range gamut vs
high/wide range gamut. Use color spaces to talk about arrangements of color,
syntax used to grab a color, manipulate color and interpolate through color.

## How to access more colors, new spaces, and debug results

[CSS Color 4](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/) outlines a bunch of new
features and tools for CSS and color. First, a recap of where color was before
these new features. Then an overview of the new color spaces, syntaxes and
tools.

The following Codepen shows all the new and old color syntaxes together:

{% Codepen { user: 'web-dot-dev', id: 'LYBNbzp' } %}

### A review of the classic color spaces

Since the 2000's, CSS has been able to ask for color with hexadecimal (hex) and
`rgb()`. Around 2010, depending on your browser, CSS could ask for color in
[`hsl()`](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_types_color_hsl). Then in 2017, [hex with
alpha](https://caniuse.com/css-rrggbbaa) appeared. Last, only recently,
[`hwb()`](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_types_color_hwb) started getting support
in browsers. **All of these color spaces reference color within the same gamut,
sRGB.**

#### HEX

{% Aside %}
Colors are in the `sRGB Gamut`; 35.9% of the visible spectrum.
{% endAside %}

<!-- {% BrowserCompat 'css.types.color.rgb_hexadecimal_notation' %} -->

The hex colorspace specifies R, G, B and A with
[hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal). The following code
examples show all the ways this syntax can specify red, green and blue plus
opacity.

```css
.valid-css-hex-colors {
  /* classic */
  --3-digits: #49b;
  --6-digits: #4095bf;

  /* hex with opacity */
  --4-digits-opaque: #f9bf;
  --8-digits-opaque: #4095bfff;
  --4-digits-with-opacity: #49b8;
  --8-digits-with-opacity: #4095bf80;
}
```

#### RGB

{% Aside %}
Colors are in the `sRGB Gamut`; 35.9% of the visible spectrum.
{% endAside %}

<!-- {% BrowserCompat 'css.types.color.rgb' %} -->

The RGB color space features direct access to the red, green and blue channels.
It allows specifying an amount between 0 and 255 or as a percentage 0 to 100.
This syntax was around before some syntax normalization was in the
specifications, so you'll see comma and no-comma syntaxes in the wild. Moving
forward, commas are no longer required.

```css
.valid-css-rgb-colors {
  --classic: rgb(64, 149, 191);
  --modern: rgb(64 149 191);
  --percents: rgb(25% 58% 75%);

  --classic-with-opacity-percent: rgba(64, 149, 191, 50%);
  --classic-with-opacity-decimal: rgba(64, 149, 191, .5);

  --modern-with-opacity-percent: rgb(64 149 191 / 50%);
  --modern-with-opacity-decimal: rgb(64 149 191 / .5);

  --percents-with-opacity-percent: rgb(25% 58% 75% / 50%);
  --percents-with-opacity-decimal: rgb(25% 58% 75% / 50%);

  --empty-channels: rgb(none none none);
}
```

#### HSL

{% Aside %}
Colors are in the `sRGB Gamut`; 35.9% of the visible spectrum.
{% endAside %}

<!-- {% BrowserCompat 'css.types.color.hsl' %} -->

One of the first color spaces to orient itself towards human language and
communication, HSL (hue saturation and lightness) offers all the colors in the
sRGB gamut while not requiring your brain to know how red, green and blue
interact. Like RGB, it also originally required commas in the syntax, but moving
forward, commas are no longer required.

```css
.valid-css-hsl-colors {


  --classic: hsl(200deg, 50%, 50%);
  --modern: hsl(200 50% 50%);

  --classic-with-opacity-percent: hsla(200deg, 50%, 50%, 50%);
  --classic-with-opacity-decimal: hsla(200deg, 50%, 50%, .5);

  --modern-with-opacity-percent: hsl(200 50% 50% / 50%);
  --modern-with-opacity-decimal: hsl(200 50% 50% / .5);

  /* hueless and no saturation */
  --empty-channels-white: hsl(none none 100%);
  --empty-channels-black: hsl(none none 0%);
}
```

#### HWB

{% Aside %}
Colors are in the `sRGB Gamut`; 35.9% of the visible spectrum.
{% endAside %}

<!-- {% BrowserCompat 'css.types.color.hwb' %} -->

Another sRGB gamut color space oriented at how humans describe color is HWB
(hue, whiteness, blackness). Authors can choose a hue and mix in white or black
to find their desired color.

```css
.valid-css-hwb-colors {
  --modern: hwb(200deg 25% 25%);
  --modern2: hwb(200 25% 25%);

  --modern-with-opacity-percent: hwb(200 25% 25% / 50%);
  --modern-with-opacity-decimal: hwb(200 25% 25% / .5);

  /* hueless and no saturation */
  --empty-channels-white: hwb(none 100% none);
  --empty-channels-black: hwb(none none 100%);
}
```

### Meet the new web color spaces

Except for `sRGB` and `sRGB-linear`, the following color spaces offer access to
larger gamuts than sRGB. The display-p3 color space offers almost twice as many
colors as RGB while Rec2020 offers almost twice as many as display-p3. **That's a
lot of colors!**

{% Img
  src="image/vS06HQ1YTsbMKSFTIPl2iogUQP73/BsVdm6fsHO8B0mBgkHQF.png",
  alt="Five stacked triangles of varying color to help illustrate
  the relationship and size of each of the new color spaces.",
  width="800",
  height="648"
%}

#### The `color()` function

{% Aside %}
Colors can be in the `sRGB Gamut`, `Display P3 Gamut`, `Rec2020 Gamut`; Up to 77.6% of the visible spectrum.
{% endAside %}

<!-- {% BrowserCompat 'css.types.color.color' %} -->

Consider this function a [higher order
function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function) for any color
spaces that specify colors with R, G and B channels; **exclusively a function
for RGB**.
[`color()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/color)
takes a color space parameter first, then a series of channel values for RGB and
optionally some alpha.

**Pros**
- A normalized space for accessing color spaces that use RGB channels.
- Can scale up to any wide gamut RGB based color space.

**Cons**
- Only useful for RGB color spaces.

```css
.valid-css-color-function-colors {
  --srgb: color(srgb 1 1 1);
  --srgb-linear: color(srgb-linear 100% 100% 100% / 50%);
  --display-p3: color(display-p3 1 1 1);
  --rec2020: color(rec2020 0 0 0);
  --a98-rgb: color(a98-rgb 1 1 1 / 25%);
  --prophoto: color(prophoto-rgb 0% 0% 0%);
  --xyz: color(xyz 1 1 1);
}
```

#### sRGB

{% Aside %}
Colors are in the `sRGB Gamut`; 35.9% of the visible spectrum.
{% endAside %}

{% Img
  src="image/vS06HQ1YTsbMKSFTIPl2iogUQP73/NHdpkEy65TGd5G0dAljh.png",
  alt="sRGB triangle is the only one fully opaque, to help visualize the size of the gamut.",
  width="800",
  height="648"
%}

This colorspace offers the same features as `rgb()`. It does additionally offer
decimals between 0 and 1, used exactly like 0% to 100%.

**Pros**

- Nearly all displays support the range of this color space.
- Design tool support.

**Cons**

- Not perceptually linear
- Gradients often go through a dead zone (to be covered later in this article).

```css
.valid-css-srgb-colors {
  --percents: color(srgb 34% 58% 73%);
  --decimals: color(srgb .34 .58 .73);

  --percents-with-opacity: color(srgb 34% 58% 73% / 50%);
  --decimals-with-opacity: color(srgb .34 .58 .73 / .5);

  /* empty */
  --empty-channels-black: color(srgb none none none);
  --empty-channels-black2: color(srgb);
}
```

#### Linear sRGB

{% Aside %}
Colors are in the `sRGB Gamut`; 35.9% of the visible spectrum.
{% endAside %}

{% Img
  src="image/vS06HQ1YTsbMKSFTIPl2iogUQP73/NHdpkEy65TGd5G0dAljh.png",
  alt="sRGB triangle is the only one fully opaque, to help visualize the size of the gamut.",
  width="800",
  height="648"
%}

This linear alternative to RGB offers predictable channel intensity.

**Pros**

- Direct access to RGB channels, handy for things like game engines or light shows.

**Cons**

- Not perceptually linear.
- Black and white are packed at the edges.

```css
.valid-css-srgb-linear-colors {
  --percents: color(srgb-linear 34% 58% 73%);
  --decimals: color(srgb-linear .34 .58 .73);

  --percents-with-opacity: color(srgb-linear 34% 58% 73% / 50%);
  --decimals-with-opacity: color(srgb-linear .34 .58 .73 / .5);

  /* empty */
  --empty-channels-black: color(srgb-linear none none none);
  --empty-channels-black2: color(srgb-linear);
}
```

#### LCH

{% Aside %}
Colors are in the `CIE Gamut`; 100% of the visible spectrum.
{% endAside %}

<!-- {% BrowserCompat 'css.types.color.lch' %} -->

The first space of this post to introduce syntax for accessing colors outside
the RGB gamut! It is also the first to make it very easy to create out of gamut
color. This is because any CIE space color is capable of representing the entire
human visible color spectrum, while a display likely is not capable.

[This colorspace is modeled after human
vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIE_1931_chromaticity_diagram) and offers
syntax to specify any of those colors. The LCH channels are lightness, chroma
and hue. Hue being an angle, like in HSL and HWB. Lightness is a value between 0
and 100, but not like HSL's lightness, it's a special human centric lightness
called perceptually linear. Chroma is like an amount of color; can range from 0
to 230 but is also technically unbounded.

**Pros**
- Predictable color manipulation thanks to being perceptually linear, mostly (see okLCH).
- Uses familiar channels.
- Often has vibrant gradients.

**Cons**
- Easy to go out of gamut.
- On rare occasions the gradient may need an adjustment middle point to prevent hue shift.

```css
.valid-css-lch-colors {
  --percent-and-degrees: lch(58% 32 241deg);
  --just-the-degrees: lch(58 32 241deg);
  --minimal: lch(58 32 241);

  --percent-opacity: lch(58% 32 241 / 50%);
  --decimal-opacity: lch(58% 32 241 / .5);

  /* chromaless and hueless */
  --empty-channels-white: lch(100 none none);
  --empty-channels-black: lch(none none none);
}
```

{% Aside 'warning' %}
Chroma can be a troublemaker, allowing authors to easily
exceed a display's gamut. Be careful with high chroma `C` values.
{% endAside %}

#### LAB

{% Aside %}
Colors are in the `CIE Gamut`; 100% of the visible spectrum.
{% endAside %}

<!-- {% BrowserCompat 'css.types.color.lab' %} -->

Another color space made to access the CIE gamut, again with a perceptually
linear lightness (L) feature. The A and B in LAB represent the unique colors of
human vision: red, green, blue and yellow. When A is given a positive value it
adds red, and adds green when it's below 0. When B is given a positive number it
adds yellow, where negative values are toward blue.

**Pros**
- Perceptually consistent gradients.
- High dynamic range.

**Cons**
- Potential for hue shift.
- Difficult to hand author or guess a color when reading values.

```css
.valid-css-lab-colors {
  --percent-and-degrees: lab(58% -16 -30);
  --minimal: lab(58 -16 -30);

  --percent-opacity: lab(58% -16 -30 / 50%);
  --decimal-opacity: lab(58% -16 -30 / .5);

  /* chromaless and hueless */
  --empty-channels-white: lab(100 none none);
  --empty-channels-black: lab(none none none);
}
```

#### OKLCH

{% Aside %}
Colors are in the `CIE Gamut`; 100% of the visible spectrum.
{% endAside %}

<!-- {% BrowserCompat 'css.types.color.oklch' %} -->

This color space, like `oklab`, is corrective to LCH and LAB's [rough
edges](https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/). The (L) continues to represent
perceptually linear lightness, while the C is for chroma and the H is for hue
which accepts an angle. This space feels fairly familiar if you've worked with
HSL or LCH. Pick an angle on the color wheel for H, choose a lightness or
darkness amount by adjusting L, but then we have chroma instead of saturation.
They're fairly identical except that adjustments to lightness and chroma tend to
come in pairs, or else it can be easy to ask for high chroma colors that go
outside of a target gamut.

**Pros**
- No surprises when working with blue and purple hues.
- Perceptually linear lightness.
- Uses familiar channels.
- High dynamic range.
- Has a modern color picker - by Evil Martians.

**Cons**
- Easy to go out of gamut.
- New and relatively unexplored.
- Few color pickers.

```css
.valid-css-oklch-colors {
  --percent-and-degrees: oklch(64% .1 233deg);
  --just-the-degrees: oklch(64 .1 233deg);
  --minimal: oklch(64 .1 233);

  --percent-opacity: oklch(64% .1 233 / 50%);
  --decimal-opacity: oklch(64% .1 233 / .5);

  /* chromaless and hueless */
  --empty-channels-white: oklch(100 none none);
  --empty-channels-black: oklch(none none none);
}
```

#### OKLAB

{% Aside %}
Colors are in the `CIE Gamut`; 100% of the visible spectrum.
{% endAside %}

<!-- {% BrowserCompat 'css.types.color.oklab' %} -->

[New since 2020](https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/), `oklab` is a
corrective colorspace modeled after LAB but without adjustments for areas where
it was performing poorly. It's claimed as a space optimized for image processing
quality, which for us in CSS means gradients and color function manipulation
quality.

**Pros**
- Perceptually linear lightness.
- No hue shift like LAB.
- Perceptually consistent gradients.

**Cons**
- New and relatively unexplored.
- Few color pickers.

```css
.valid-css-oklab-colors {
  --percent-and-degrees: oklab(64% -.1 -.1);
  --minimal: oklab(64 -.1 -.1);

  --percent-opacity: oklab(64% -.1 -.1 / 50%);
  --decimal-opacity: oklab(64% -.1 -.1 / .5);

  /* chromaless and hueless */
  --empty-channels-white: oklab(100 none none);
  --empty-channels-black: oklab(none none none);
}
```

#### Display P3

{% Aside %}
Colors are in the `Display P3 Gamut`; 45.5% of the visible spectrum.
{% endAside %}

<!-- {% BrowserCompat 'css.types.color.color' %} -->

{% Img
  src="image/vS06HQ1YTsbMKSFTIPl2iogUQP73/IbvUXdmGexli8BzWT6BQ.png",
  alt="Display P3 triangle is the only one fully opaque, to help
  visualize the size of the gamut. It looks like 2nd from the smallest.",
  width="800",
  height="648"
%}

The display P3 gamut and color space have become popular since Apple supported
them since 2015 on their iMac. Apple also supported display-p3 [in web pages via
CSS since 2016](https://webkit.org/blog/6682/improving-color-on-the-web/), five
years ahead of any other browser. If coming from sRGB, this is a great color
space to begin working within as you move styles to a higher dynamic range.

**Pros**
- Great support, considered the baseline for HDR displays.
- 50% more colors than sRGB.
- Safari makes a great color picker.

**Cons**
- Will eventually be replaced by Rec2020 and CIE spaces.

```css
.valid-css-display-p3-colors {
  --percents: color(display-p3 34% 58% 73%);
  --decimals: color(display-p3 .34 .58 .73);

  --percent-opacity: color(display-p3 34% 58% 73% / 50%);
  --decimal-opacity: color(display-p3 .34 .58 .73 / .5);

  /* chromaless and hueless */
  --empty-channels-black: color(display-p3 none none none);
  --empty-channels-black2: color(display-p3);
}
```

#### Rec2020

{% Aside %}
Colors are in the `Rec2020 Gamut`; 77.6% of the visible spectrum.
{% endAside %}

<!-- {% BrowserCompat 'css.types.color.color' %} -->

{% Img
  src="image/vS06HQ1YTsbMKSFTIPl2iogUQP73/gPrHRZsrH3CALon2PjhF.png",
  alt="Rec2020 triangle is the only one fully opaque, to help
  visualize the size of the gamut. It looks like 2nd from the largest.",
  width="800",
  height="648"
%}

Rec2020 is part of the movement to UHDTV (ultra-high-definition television),
providing a wide range of colors for use in 4k and 8k media. Rec2020 is another
RGB based gamut, larger than display-p3, but not nearly as common for someone to
own for personal use.

**Pros**
- Ultra HD colors.

**Cons**
- Not as common among households (yet).
- Not commonly found in handhelds or tablets.

```css
.valid-css-rec2020-colors {
  --percents: color(rec2020 34% 58% 73%);
  --decimals: color(rec2020 .34 .58 .73);

  --percent-opacity: color(rec2020 34% 58% 73% / 50%);
  --decimal-opacity: color(rec2020 .34 .58 .73 / .5);

  /* chromaless and hueless */
  --empty-channels-black: color(rec2020 none none none);
  --empty-channels-black2: color(rec2020);
}
```

#### A98 RGB

{% Aside %}
Colors are in the `RGB 98 Gamut`; 52.1% of the visible spectrum.
{% endAside %}

<!-- {% BrowserCompat 'css.types.color.color' %} -->

{% Img
  src="image/vS06HQ1YTsbMKSFTIPl2iogUQP73/9z2v7IsWm5KsPwm0xsZf.png",
  alt="A98 triangle is the only one fully opaque, to help
  visualize the size of the gamut. It looks like the middle sizes triangle.",
  width="800",
  height="648"
%}

Short for Adobe 1998 RGB, A98 RGB was created by Adobe to feature most of the
colors achievable from CMYK printers. It offers more colors than sRGB, notably
in the cyan and green hues.

**Pros**
- Larger than the sRGB and Display P3 color spaces.

**Cons**
- Not a common space worked within by web designers.
- Not many folks porting palettes from CMYK.

```css
.valid-css-a98-rgb-colors {
  --percents: color(a98-rgb 34% 58% 73%);
  --decimals: color(a98-rgb .34 .58 .73);

  --percent-opacity: color(a98-rgb 34% 58% 73% / 50%);
  --decimal-opacity: color(a98-rgb .34 .58 .73 / .5);

  /* chromaless and hueless */
  --empty-channels-black: color(a98-rgb none none none);
  --empty-channels-black2: color(a98-rgb);
}
```

#### ProPhoto RGB

{% Aside %}
Colors are in the `ProPhoto Gamut`; 90% of the visible spectrum.
{% endAside %}

<!-- {% BrowserCompat 'css.types.color.color' %} -->

{% Img
  src="image/vS06HQ1YTsbMKSFTIPl2iogUQP73/y5WlpdsjCVAjFgep3cT1.png",
  alt="ProPhoto triangle is the only one fully opaque, to help
  visualize the size of the gamut. It looks like the largest.",
  width="800",
  height="648"
%}

Created by Kodak, this wide gamut space uniquely offers ultra wide range primary
colors and features minimal hue shifts when changing lightness. It also claims
to cover 100% of [real-world surface
colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munsell_color_system) as documented by
Michael Pointer in
1980.

**Pros**
- Minimal hue shifts when changing lightness.
- Vibrant primary colors.

**Cons**
- Around 13% of its colors offered are imaginary, meaning they're not within the human visible spectrum.

```css
.valid-css-prophoto-rgb-colors {
  --percents: color(prophoto-rgb 34% 58% 73%);
  --decimals: color(prophoto-rgb .34 .58 .73);

  --percent-opacity: color(prophoto-rgb 34% 58% 73% / 50%);
  --decimal-opacity: color(prophoto-rgb .34 .58 .73 / .5);

  /* chromaless and hueless */
  --empty-channels-black: color(prophoto-rgb none none none);
  --empty-channels-black2: color(prophoto-rgb);
}
```

#### XYZ, XYZ-d50, XYZ-d65

{% Aside %}
Colors are in the `HVS Gamut`; 100% of the human visible spectrum (HVS).
{% endAside %}

<!-- {% BrowserCompat 'css.types.color.color' %} -->

The CIE XYZ color space encompasses all color sensations that are visible to a
person with average eyesight. This is why it is used as a standard reference for
other color spaces. Y is luminance, X and Z are possible chromas within the
given Y luminance.

The difference between d50 and d65 is the white point, where d50 uses the d50
white points and d65 uses the d65 white point.

**Pros**
- Linear-light access has handy use cases.
- Great for physical color mixing.

**Cons**
- Not perceptually uniform.

```css
.valid-css-xyz-colors {
  --percents: color(xyz 22% 26% 53%);
  --decimals: color(xyz .22 .26 .53);

  --percent-opacity: color(xyz .22 .26 .53 / 50%);
  --decimal-opacity: color(xyz .22 .26 .53 / .5);

  /* chromaless and hueless */
  --empty-channels-black: color(xyz none none none);
  --empty-channels-black2: color(xyz);
}
```

```css
.valid-css-xyz-d50-colors {
  --percents: color(xyz-d50 22% 26% 53%);
  --decimals: color(xyz-d50 .22 .26 .53);

  --percent-opacity: color(xyz-d50 .22 .26 .53 / 50%);
  --decimal-opacity: color(xyz-d50 .22 .26 .53 / .5);

  /* chromaless and hueless */
  --empty-channels-black: color(xyz-d50 none none none);
  --empty-channels-black2: color(xyz-d50);
}
```

```css
.valid-css-xyz-d65-colors {
  --percents: color(xyz-d65 22% 26% 53%);
  --decimals: color(xyz-d65 .22 .26 .53);

  --percent-opacity: color(xyz-d65 .22 .26 .53 / 50%);
  --decimal-opacity: color(xyz-d65 .22 .26 .53 / .5);

  /* chromaless and hueless */
  --empty-channels-black: color(xyz-d65 none none none);
  --empty-channels-black2: color(xyz-d65);
}
```

#### Custom color spaces

<!-- {% BrowserCompat 'css.at-rules.color-profile' %} -->

[The CSS Color 5 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-5) also has a
path for teaching the browser a [custom color
space](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-5/#custom-color). This is an [ICC
profile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_profile) that tells the browser how
to resolve colors.

```css
@color-profile --foo {
  src: url(path/to/custom.icc);
}
```

Once loaded, access colors from this custom profile with the `color()` function
and specify the channel values for it.

```css
.valid-css-color-from-a-custom-profile {
  background: color(--foo 1 0 0);
}
```

### Color interpolation

Transitioning from one color to another is found in animation, gradients and
color mixing. This transition is typically specified as a starting color and an
ending color, where the browser is expected to interpolate between them.
Interpolate in this case means to generate a series of in-between colors to
create a smooth transition instead of an instant one.

With a gradient, the interpolation is a series of colors along a size. With
animation it's a series of colors over time.

```css
@keyframes bg {
  0%, 100% {
    background: blue;
  }
  50% {
    background: white;
  }
}

.circle {
  animation: bg 5s ease-in-out infinite;
}
```

{% Codepen { user: 'web-dot-dev', id: 'QWBNdpX' } %}

With a gradient, the in-between colors are shown all at once:

{% Codepen { user: 'web-dot-dev', id: 'yLqOgby' } %}

#### What's new in color interpolation

With the addition of new gamuts and color spaces, there are new additional
options for interpolation. Transitioning a color `in hsl` from blue to white
results in something very different from sRGB.

```css
.new-gradient-feature {
  background: linear-gradient(in hsl to right, blue, white);
}
```

{% Codepen { user: 'web-dot-dev', id: 'YzjqNVe' } %}

Then what happens if you transition from a color in one space to a color in a
completely different space:

```css
.gradient {
  background: linear-gradient(to right, lch(29.6 131 301), hsl(330 100% 50%));
}
```

{% Codepen { user: 'web-dot-dev', id: 'jOpqymg' } %}

Luckily for you, the [Color 4](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#interpolation)
specification has instructions for the browsers on how to handle these cross
color space interpolations. In the above case, browsers should look at the first
color's color space for the gradient's color space. This is called the [host
syntax](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#host-syntax), the first color becomes
the host and its syntax determines the space.

##### Less banding thanks to 16-bit color

Until now in Chrome, all colors were saved in 8-bit memory, but in order to
support HD color these needed to be upgraded to 16-bit. This increases the
amount of color information that can be stored, which has a nice side effect of
meaning there's more colors for the browser to use in a gradient.

Gradient banding is when there aren't enough colors to create the illusion of a
gradient, where "strips" of color become visible. Banding is heavily mitigated
with the upgrade to more color information now available to the browser engine.

    height="674"
  %}

    Image <a href="https://www.willgibbons.com/color-banding/">source</a>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

#### Controlling interpolation

The shortest distance between two points is always a straight line. With color
interpolation, browsers take the short route by default. Consider a scenario
where there are two points in an HSL color cylinder. A gradient acquires its
color steps by traveling along the line between the two points.

```css
linear-gradient(#94E99C, #E06242)
```

<figure>
  {% Img
    src="image/vS06HQ1YTsbMKSFTIPl2iogUQP73/9pRCMoY7vQjTXXQ1fpQL.png",
    alt="A circular gradient with a line from green to red, straight
    through the circle, going through the white areas.",
    width="389",
    height="388"
  %}

  <figcaption>
    (mock demonstration) <br>
    Top down view, of an HSL cylinder with a line between the color stops
  </figcaption>
</figure>

The above gradient line goes straight between the greenish color to the reddish
color, passing through the center of the color space. While the above is great
to help with initial understanding, it's not exactly what happens. Here is the
gradient in the following Codepen, and it's clearly not white in the middle like
the mock demonstration showed.

{% Codepen { user: 'web-dot-dev', id: 'xxJVgXd' } %}

The middle area of the gradient has lost its vibrance though. This is because
the most vibrant colors are at the edge of the color space shape, not in the
center where the interpolation traveled near. This is commonly referred to as
the "dead zone." There are a few ways to fix or work around this.

##### Specifying more gradient stops to avoid the dead zone

A technique for avoiding the dead zone today is to add additional color stops in
the gradient that intentionally guide the interpolation to stay within the
vibrant ranges of a color space. It is literally a work around, as the
additional stops help it work around the dead zone.

There's a [gradient
tool](https://www.learnui.design/tools/gradient-generator.html) created by [Erik
Kennedy](https://twitter.com/erikdkennedy) that calculates additional color
stops for you, to help you avoid the dead zone even in color spaces that tend to
gravitate towards it. Using it, passing the same colors from the first example
but changing the color interpolation to HSL, it produces this:

```css
linear-gradient(90deg, #94e99c, #99e789, #ace67d, #c4e472, #e2e366, #e2bf5a, #e1934e, #e06242);
```

<figure>
  {% Img
    src="image/vS06HQ1YTsbMKSFTIPl2iogUQP73/HZBi2AZMlXKGgROf7eJ7.png",
    alt="A circular gradient with a line curving around the middle with many
    gradient stops along the way, guiding it away from the center.",
    width="389",
    height="388"
  %}

  <figcaption>
    (mock demonstration)<br>
    Top down view of an HSL cylinder with a curved line featuring 9 color stops
  </figcaption>
</figure>

With guided stop points, the interpolation is no longer a straight line, but
appears to curve around the dead zone, helping maintain saturation, resulting in
a much more vibrant gradient.

{% Codepen { user: 'web-dot-dev', id: 'MWByJrK' } %}

While the tool does a great job, **what if you could have similar or greater
control right from CSS?**

##### Directing the color interpolation

In Color 4, the ability to control the [hue
interpolation](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#hue-interpolation) strategy
was added and is a new way around (:wink:) the dead zone. Think about a hue
angle and consider a 2 stop gradient that only changes the angle, going hue
shifting from `140deg` to `240deg` for example.

{% Codepen { user: 'web-dot-dev', id: 'qByZRvo' } %}

###### Shorter vs longer hue interpolation

The gradient will by default take the
[`shorter`](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#hue-shorter) route it can unless
you specify for it to take the
[`longer`](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#hue-longer) route. Hue
interpolation options direct the angle rotation, like telling someone to turn
left instead of right:

{% Img
  src="image/vS06HQ1YTsbMKSFTIPl2iogUQP73/V0JdsZ7r3nOUiUlytR5K.png",
  alt="The same gradient circle visual as before, but this time there is an
  inner circle drawn that shows the long way vs the short way.",
  width="389",
  height="388"
%}

In the above visual example of hue interpolation distances, the short path and
the long path are simulated to illustrate the difference. The short distance has
less hues between it because it's traveled through the least amount of distance
possible, where the long distance will have traveled over more hues.

###### Increasing vs decreasing hue interpolation

There are two more hue interpolation strategies in [Color
4](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4), but they are exclusive for cylindrical
color spaces. Staying with the two colors from the previous examples, the visual
now shows how increasing and decreasing works.

{% Codepen { user: 'web-dot-dev', id: 'abjNpxV' } %}

The above Codepen used [ColorJS](https://colorjs.io/) to demonstrate the
expected result. The CSS you would write to achieve the same effect without a
Javascript library would be:

```css
.longer-hue-interpolation-in-css {
  background: linear-gradient(
    to right in hsl longer hue,
    hsl(180deg 100% 75%),
    hsl(240deg 100% 75%)
  );
}

.decreasing-hue-interpolation-in-css {
  background: linear-gradient(
    to right in hsl decreasing hue,
    hsl(180deg 100% 75%),
    hsl(240deg 100% 75%)
  );
}
```

To close out hue interpolation, here's a fun playground where you can change the
hue between 2 color stops and see the effects of a hue interpolation choice as
well as how color spaces change gradient results. The effects can be very
different; consider this as four new tricks just went into your color toolbelt.

{% Codepen { user: 'web-dot-dev', id: 'yLqOgda' } %}

#### Gradients in different color spaces

Each color space, given its unique shape and color arrangement, will result in a
different gradient!

{% Codepen { user: 'web-dot-dev', id: 'JjBXEQL' } %}

Some gradients in these spaces will be more vibrant than others or travel less
through [dead
zones](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pMnudZk0NYDKiXnd81Mr_wq5td_EyBge2MYGfZGArDQ/edit?pli=1#heading=h.7026o5wx1px3).
Spaces like `lab` pack colors together in a way optimized for saturation, as
opposed to spaces optimized for humans to write color in like `hwb()`.

```css
.hwb {
  background: linear-gradient(to right, hwb(250 10% 10%), hwb(150 10% 10%));
}
.lab {
  background: linear-gradient(to right, lab(30 59.4 -96), lab(80 -64 36.2));
}
```

{% Codepen { user: 'web-dot-dev', id: 'bGjpgXN' } %}

The above demo, while subtle in the results, does show more consistent
interpolation with LAB. The syntax of LAB isn't simple to read though, there's
negative numbers that are very unfamiliar when coming from RGB or HSL. Good
news, we can use HWB for a familiar syntax but ask for the gradient to be
interpolated entirely within another color space, like OKLAB.

```css
.hwb {
  background: linear-gradient(in hwb to right, hwb(250 10% 10%), hwb(150 10% 10%));
}
.lab {
  background: linear-gradient(in oklab to right, hwb(250 10% 10%), hwb(150 10% 10%));
}
```

{% Codepen { user: 'web-dot-dev', id: 'rNrejXw' } %}

This example uses the same colors in HWB but specifies the color space for
interpolation to either HWB or OKLAB. HWB is a great colorspace for high
vibrance but possible dead zones or bright spots (see the cyan hot spot in the
top example). OKLAB is great for perceptually linear gradients that stay
saturated. This feature is a lot of fun as you can try on a few different color
spaces to see which gradient you like best.

Here's a Codepen experimenting with gradients and color spaces, mixing and
matching strategies to explore the possibilities. Even a transition from black
to white is different in each color space!

{% Codepen { user: 'web-dot-dev', id: 'JjBXEQL' } %}

### Gamut mapping vs gamut clamping

There exist scenarios where a color may ask for something outside of a gamut.
Consider the following color:

```css
rgb(300 255 255)
```

The maximum for a color channel in the `rgb` color space is `255`, but here
`300` was specified for red. What happens?

In this case, gamut clamping will occur. Clamping is when extra information is
simply removed. `300` will become `255` internally to the color engine. The
color has been clamped within its space.

The example there was easy to understand I hope, extra information that was
impossible to represent was just removed. But, consider this color:

```css
lch(50% 500 200deg)
```

This is asking for a 50% light blue that's super saturated at `500`, the chroma
is double or triple what may be considered normal. In LCH this is ok, the chroma
is unbounded, and this color very well may exist in Rec2020 or larger color
spaces. If the color was clamped though, there's a likely chance that the hue
would shift and there'd be actual fidelity loss to the color. This is where
gamut mapping comes in.

Gamut mapping doesn't remove the extra color information with a delete button,
it adjusts the color to fit into a color space, attempting to maintain as much
of the original intent of the color as possible. Almost like the color is
squished into the space instead of cutoff (gamut clamping).

The [CSS Color 4](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#gamut-mapping)
specification outlines how gamut mapping and clipping should occur. If you're
interested in this topic, that specification holds many great details for you to
study. For now, assume the browsers will align on behavior so your colors are
mapped the same everywhere, and you can trust there's interoperability and
consistency.

### Choosing a color space

Many folks, after learning about these color spaces and their effects, feel
overwhelmed and want to know which "one" to choose. From my studies and
experience, I don't see one color space as the single one for all my tasks. Each
has moments when they produce the desired outcome.

If there was one best space, then there wouldn't be so many new spaces being
introduced.

However, I can say that the CIE spaces—`lab`, `oklab`, `lch` and `oklch`—are my
starting places. If the outcome of them isn't what I'm looking for, then I'll go
test other spaces.

Here are a couple articles where folks have shared their updated color
strategies given these new color spaces and features. For example, Andrey Sitnik
has gone all in on OKLCH, maybe they'll convince you to do the same:

1. [OKLCH in CSS: why we moved from RGB and
   HSL](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/oklch-in-css-why-quit-rgb-hsl) by
   [Andrey Sitnik](https://twitter.com/sitnikcode)
1. [Color
   Formats](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/color-formats/#picking-the-right-color-format)
   by [Josh W. Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/)

## Migrating to HD CSS color

There are two main strategies for updating your web project color to support
wide gamut displays:

1. **Graceful degradation**<br>Use the new color spaces and let the browser and
   operating system figure out which color to show based on display capabilities.

1. **Progressive enhancement**<br>Use `@supports` and `@media` to assess the
   capabilities of the user's browser, and if conditions are met, provide wide
   gamut colors.

If a browser doesn't understand `display-p3` color:

```css//1
color: red;
color: color(display-p3 1 0 0);
```

If a browser does understand `display-p3` color:

```css//0
color: red;
color: color(display-p3 1 0 0);
```

There are advantages and disadvantages to each. Here's a quick list of pros and
cons:

**Graceful degradation**
- Pros
  - The simplest route.
  - The browser will gamut map or clamp to sRGB if not a wide gamut display, therefore the responsibility is on the browser.
- Cons
  - The browser may gamut clamp or gamut map to a color you don't love.
  - The browser may not understand the color request and fail entirely. However this can be mitigated by specifying the color twice, letting the cascade fallback to the previous color it does understand.

**Progressive enhancement**
- Pros
  - More control with managed color fidelity.
  - An additive strategy that doesn't affect the current colors.
- Cons
  - You need to manage two separate color syntaxes.
  - You need to manage two separate color gamuts.

### Checking for gamut and color space support

The browser allows checking for support for wide gamut capabilities and color
syntax support from CSS and JavaScript. The exact gamut of colors the user has
is not made available, a generalized answer is provided so user privacy is
maintained. The exact color space support is made available though, as it's not
specific to capabilities of the user's hardware like gamut is.

#### Color gamut support queries

The following code examples check the visiting user's range of colors in their
display.

##### Checking from CSS

The least specific support inquiry is the
[`dynamic-range`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/@media/dynamic-range)
media query:

<!-- {% BrowserCompat 'css.at-rules.media.dynamic-range' %} -->

```css
@media (dynamic-range: high) {
  /* safe to use HD colors */
}
```

Approximate, or more, support can be inquired with the
[`color-gamut`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/@media/color-gamut)
media query:

<!-- {% BrowserCompat 'css.at-rules.media.color-gamut' %} -->

```css
@media (color-gamut: srgb) {
  /* safe to use srgb colors */
}

@media (color-gamut: p3) {
  /* safe to use p3 colors */
}

@media (color-gamut: rec2020) {
  /* safe to use rec2020 colors */
}
```

There are an additional two media queries for checking support:
1. [`@media (color)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/@media/color)
1. [`@media (color-index)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/@media/color-index)

##### Checking from JavaScript

For JavaScript, the
[`window.matchMedia()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia)
function can be called and passed a media query for evaluation.

<!-- {% BrowserCompat 'api.Window.matchMedia' %} -->

```js
const hasHighDynamicRange = window
.matchMedia('(dynamic-range: high)')
.matches;

console.log(hasHighDynamicRange); // true || false

const hasP3Color = window
.matchMedia('(color-gamut: p3)')
.matches;

console.log(hasP3Color); // true || false
```

The above pattern can be copied for the rest of the media queries.

#### Color space support queries

The following code examples check the visiting user's browser and its selection
of color spaces to work with.

##### Checking from CSS

Individual color space support can be inquired using an
[`@supports`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/@supports) query:

<!-- {% BrowserCompat 'css.at-rules.supports' %} -->

```css
@supports (background: rgb(0 0 0)) {
  /* rgb color space supported */
}


@supports (background: color(display-p3 0 0 0)) {
  /* display-p3 color space supported */
}


@supports (background: oklch(0 0 0)) {
  /* oklch color space supported */
}
```

##### Checking from JavaScript

For JavaScript, the
[`CSS.supports()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/CSS/supports)
function can be called and passed a property and value pair to see if the
browser understands.

<!-- {% BrowserCompat 'api.CSS.supports' %} -->

```js
CSS.supports('background: rgb(0 0 0)')
CSS.supports('background: color(display-p3 0 0 0)')
CSS.supports('background: oklch(0 0 0)')
```

#### Putting the hardware and parsing checks together

While waiting for each browser to implement these new color features, it's a
good idea to check for both hardware capability and color parsing capability.
This is often what I use when progressively enhancing colors to high definition:

```css
:root {
  --neon-red: rgb(100% 0 0);
  --neon-blue: rgb(0 0 100%);
}

/* is the display HD? */
@media (dynamic-range: high) {

  /* does this browser understand display-p3? */
  @supports (color: color(display-p3 0 0 0)) {

    /* safe to use display-p3 colors */
    --neon-red: color(display-p3 1 0 0);
    --neon-blue: color(display-p3 0 0 1);
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

Color spaces on the web are in early days but I believe we'll see an increase in
usage from designers and developers over time. Knowing which color space to
build a design system on, for example, is a strong tool to be in a creator
toolbelt. Each color space offers a unique feature and reason it was added to
the CSS specification, and it is ok to start small with these and add as needed.

Enjoy playing with these new color toys! More vibrance, consistent manipulations
and interpolations and overall deliver a more colorful experience to your users.
