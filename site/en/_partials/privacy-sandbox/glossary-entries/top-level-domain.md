Top-level domains such as .com and .org are listed in the
[Root Zone Database](https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db).

Note that some 'sites' are actually just subdomains. For example,
`translate.google.com` and `maps.google.com` are subdomains of `google.com`. These subdomains are [eTLD + 1](#etld).
