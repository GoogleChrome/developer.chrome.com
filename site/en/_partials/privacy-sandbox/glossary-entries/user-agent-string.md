A user-agent string is an HTTP header used by servers and network peers to request identifying
information about an application, operating system, vendor, or version of a
user agent. The User-Agent string broadcasts a large string of data, which is
problematic for user privacy. [User-Agent
reduction](/docs/privacy-sandbox/user-agent/) is proposed to remove sensitive
information and reduce passive fingerprinting.
