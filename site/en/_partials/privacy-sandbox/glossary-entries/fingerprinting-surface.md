A fingerprinting surface is something that can be used (probably in combination with other surfaces) to
identify a particular user or device.

For example, the `navigator.userAgent()` JavaScript method and the `User-Agent`
HTTP request header provide access to a fingerprinting surface (the User-Agent
string).
