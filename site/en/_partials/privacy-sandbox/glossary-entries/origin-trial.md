## Origin trial {: #origin-trial}

Trials provide access to a new or experimental feature, to make it possible to
build functions that users can try out for a limited time before the feature is made available to everyone.

When Chrome offers an origin trial for a feature, an [origin](#origin) can be
registered for the trial to allow the feature for all users on that origin,
without requiring users to toggle flags or switch to an alternative build of
Chrome (though they may need to upgrade). Origin trials allow developers to
build demos and prototypes using new features. The trials help Chrome engineers
understand how new features are used, and how they may interact with other web technologies.
