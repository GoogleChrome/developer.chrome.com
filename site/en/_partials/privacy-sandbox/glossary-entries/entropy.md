Entropy, in the privacy domain, is a measure of how much an item of data reveals individual identity.

Data entropy is measured in bits. The more that data reveals identity, the higher its entropy value.

Data can be combined to identify an individual, but it can be difficult to work
out whether new data adds to entropy. For example, knowing a person is from
Australia doesn't reduce entropy if you already know the person is from
Kangaroo Island.
