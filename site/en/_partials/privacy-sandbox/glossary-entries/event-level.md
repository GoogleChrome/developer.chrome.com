[Event-level reports](/docs/privacy-sandbox/attribution-reporting/#event-level-reports) associate a particular ad click or view (on the ad side) with data on the conversion side. To preserve user privacy by limiting the joining of user identity across sites, conversion-side data is very limited, and the data is noisy. An event-level report represents one action rather than many user actions.
