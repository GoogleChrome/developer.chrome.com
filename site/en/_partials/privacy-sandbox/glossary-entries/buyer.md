A buyer  is a party bidding for ad space in an [ad auction](#ad-auction), likely to be a
[DSP](#DSP), or maybe the advertiser itself. Ad space buyers own and manage
interest groups. 

Publishers make [ad inventory](#ad-inventory) available through marketplaces called ad exchanges, and buyers compete in real time through a [DSP](#dsp) for the opportunity to place their advertisement.
