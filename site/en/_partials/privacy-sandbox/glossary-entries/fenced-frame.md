A (`<fencedframe>`) is a proposed HTML element for embedded content, similar to
an [iframe](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe). Unlike
iframes, a fenced frame restricts communication with its embedding context to
allow the frame access to cross-site data without sharing it with the embedding
context.

Some Privacy Sandbox APIs may require select documents to render within a
fenced frame. Learn more about the
[Fenced Frames proposal](/docs/privacy-sandbox/fenced-frame/).
