eTLDs are effective top-level domains (TLD), which are defined by the
[Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/list/).

For example:

```text
co.uk 
github.io 
glitch.me
``` 

Effective TLDs are what allow `foo.appspot.com` to be a different site from
`bar.appspot.com`. The eTLD in this case is `appspot.com`, and the whole
site name (`foo.appspot.com`, `bar.appspot.com`) is known as the eTLD+1.
