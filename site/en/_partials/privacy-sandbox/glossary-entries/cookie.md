## Cookie

A small piece of textual data that websites can store on a user's browser.
Cookies can be used by a website to save information associated with a user
(or a reference to data stored on the website's backend servers) as the user
moves across the web.

For example, an online store can retain shopping cart details even if a user is
not logged in, or the site could record the user's browsing activity on their
site. See [First-party cookie](#first-party-cookie) and
[Third-party cookie](#third-party-cookie).
