Passive surfaces are [fingerprinting surfaces](#fingerprinting-surface)&mdash;such as 
User-Agent strings, IP addresses, and Accept-Language headers&mdash;that are
available to every website, whether the site asks for them or not.

Passive surfaces can easily consume a site's privacy budget.

The Privacy Sandbox initiative proposes replacing passive surfaces with active
ways to get specific information, for example using Client Hints a single time
to get the user's language rather than having an Accept-Language header for
every response to every server.
