Third party refers to resources served from a domain that's different from the website you're
visiting.

For example, a website `foo.com` might use analytics code from
`google-analytics.com` (via JavaScript), fonts from
`use.typekit.net` (via a link element) and a video from `vimeo.com` (in an
iframe). See also [First-party](#first-party).
