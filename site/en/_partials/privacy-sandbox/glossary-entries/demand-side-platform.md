A demand-side platform is an ad tech service used to automate ad purchasing. DSPs are used by advertisers
to buy [ad impressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impression_(online_media))
across a range of publisher sites. Publishers put their
[ad inventory](#ad-inventory) up for sale through marketplaces called ad
exchanges, and DSPs decide programmatically which available ad impression makes
most sense for an advertiser to buy.
