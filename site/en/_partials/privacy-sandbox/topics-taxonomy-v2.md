{% Aside %}
There is a [new improved taxonomy](https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/topics/blob/main/taxonomy_v2.md), updated June 15, 2023 in which we added 280 commercially focused categories, like "Athletic Apparel", "Mattresses", and "Luxury Travel," while removing 160 categories including topics like "Civil Engineering" and "Equestrian". Examples here use [version 1](https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/topics/blob/main/taxonomy_v1.md) of the taxonomy.
Chrome will begin using the new taxonomy later this year, but you can view it here, and provide feedback.
