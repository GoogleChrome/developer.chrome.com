This article is part of a series on debugging the [Attribution Reporting API](/docs/privacy-sandbox/attribution-reporting/system-overview/).
This series covers client-side debugging for event-level reports and aggregatable reports. Server-side debugging guidance for summary reports is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/privacysandbox/aggregation-service/blob/main/docs/DEBUGGING.md). The [Experiment with Attribution Reporting Handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BXchEk-UMgcr2fpjfXrQ3D8VhTR-COGYS1cwK_nyLfg/edit#) provides additional information.
