<!-- ## Preview feature: New Performance insights panel {: #perf } -->

<!-- Use the **Performance insights** panel to get actionable and use-case-driven insights on your website's performance. -->

<!-- [Open the panel](/docs/devtools/performance-insights/#open) and start a new recording based on your use case. For example, let’s measure the page load of this [demo page](https://coffee-cart.netlify.app/?ad=1). -->

{% Img src="image/dPDCek3EhZgLQPGtEG3y0fTn4v82/EjgH5CD6FHnzoEhDEWxu.png", alt="New Performance insights panel", width="800", height="585" %}

<!-- Once the recording is complete, you get the performance insights on the  **Insights** pane. Click on each insight item (for example, Render blocking request, layout shift) to understand the issue and potential fixes.  -->

<!-- Go to the **Performance insights** panel [documentation](/docs/devtools/performance-insights/) to learn more with the step-by-step tutorial.  -->

<!-- This is a preview feature to help web developers (especially non-performance experts) to identify and fix potential performance issues. Our team is actively working on this feature and we are looking for your [feedback](https://crbug.com/1270700) for further enhancements. -->

Chromium issue: [1270700](https://crbug.com/1270700)


<!-- ## New shortcuts to emulate light and dark themes {: #emulation } -->

<!-- You can now emulate the light and dark themes quicker (CSS media feature [prefers-color-scheme](https://web.dev/prefers-color-scheme/#the-prefers-color-scheme-media-query)) with the new shortcuts in the **Styles** pane. -->

<!-- Previously, it took more steps to [emulate themes](/docs/devtools/rendering/emulate-css/) in the **Rendering** tab.   -->

Chromium issue: [1314299](https://crbug.com/1314299)


<!-- ## Improve security on the Network Preview tab {: #network-preview } -->

<!-- DevTools now apply the Content Security Policy (CSP) in the **Preview** tab in the **Network** panel. -->

<!-- For example, the first screenshot shows a page that contains [mixed content](https://web.dev/what-is-mixed-content/). The page loads over a secure HTTPS connection, but the stylesheet loads over an insecure HTTP connection. -->

<!-- The browser blocked the stylesheet request by default. However, when you opened the page via the **Preview** tab in the **Network** panel, the stylesheet was not blocked previously (hence the background turned into red). It is now blocked as you would expect (second screenshot). -->

Chromium issue: [833147](https://crbug.com/833147)


<!-- ## Improved reloading at breakpoint {: #debugger } -->

<!-- The debugger now terminates script execution when reloading at breakpoint. -->

<!-- For example, the script got into an endless loop previously when setting and reloading at the `ReactDOM` breakpoint in this [React demo](https://react-stuck.glitch.me/). The **Sources** panel broke due to the endless loop.  -->

<!-- Continuing to execute JavaScript is causing a lot of trouble for developers and might leave the renderer in a broken state. This change aligns the debugging behavior with other browsers like Firefox. -->

<!-- ## Console updates  {: #console } -->

<!-- ### Handle script execution errors in the Console {: #errors } -->

<!-- Errors during script evaluation in the Console now generate proper error events that trigger the `window.onerror` handler and are dispatched as `"error"` events on the window object. -->

<!-- ### Commit live expression with Enter {: #live-expression } -->

<!-- Once you finish typing a [live expression](/blog/new-in-devtools-70/#watch), you can click `Enter` to commit it. Previously, hitting Enter resulted in adding new lines. This is inconsistent with other parts of the DevTools.  -->

<!-- To add a new line in the **live expression** editor, use `Shift` + `Enter` instead. -->

Chromium issue: [1260744](https://crbug.com/1260744)


<!-- ## Cancel user flow recording at the start {: #recorder } -->

<!-- You can cancel the recording during the start of user flow recording. Previously, there was no option to cancel the recording. -->

Chromium issue: [1257499](https://crbug.com/1257499)


<!-- ## Display inherited highlight pseudo-elements in the Styles pane {: #pseudo } -->

<!-- View the inherited highlight pseudo-elements  (e.g. `::selection`, `::spelling-error`, `::grammar-error`, and `::highlight`) in the **Styles** pane. Previously, these rules were not displayed. -->

<!-- As mentioned in the [specification](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-pseudo-4/#highlight-cascade), when multiple styles conflict, cascade determines the winning style. This new feature helps you understand the inheritance and priority of the rules. -->

{% Aside %}
<!-- At the moment, you need to run Chrome with the `--enable-blink-features=HighlightInheritance` flag to enable this feature. -->

Chromium issue: [1024156](https://crbug.com/1024156)


<!-- ## Miscellaneous highlights {: #misc } -->

<!-- These are some noteworthy fixes in this release: -->

<!-- - The **Properties** pane now displays accessor properties with value by default. It was hidden mistakenly previously. ([1309087](https://crbug.com/1309087))
- The **Styles** pane now properly shows the overridden `@support` rules as strikethrough. Previously, the rules weren’t strikethrough. ([1298025](https://crbug.com/1298025))
- Fixed the CSS formatting logic in the **Sources** panel that caused multiple blank lines when editing CSS. ([1309588](https://crbug.com/1309588))
- Cap the **Expand recursively** option of an object in the **Console** to maximum 100 so it does not go on forever for circular objects. ([1272450](https://crbug.com/1272450)) -->

<!-- To enable the experiment, check **Sync CSS changes in the Styles pane** under **Settings** > **Experiments**. -->
{% endAside %}

<!-- With this experiment, the **Styles** pane highlights your CSS changes in green. You can hover over the changed rules and click on the new copy button next to it to copy it. -->

<!-- Apart from that, you can copy all CSS changes across declarations by right-clicking on any rule, and selecting **Copy all CSS changes**. -->

<!-- A new **Copy** button is added to the [Changes](/docs/devtools/changes/) tab as well to help you keep track and copy your CSS changes with ease! -->

<!-- Enable this experiment to pick a color outside of the browser with the color picker. Previously, you could only pick a color within the browser. -->
