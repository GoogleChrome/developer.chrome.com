Welcome to D&B Direct 2.0
D&B Direct is an application programming interface that allows you to stream reliable, on-demand business information into enterprise-wide systems, such as Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems, corporate intranets and web forms, and supply chain management systems or commercial software and web applications.

IMPORTANT: Please see the new Online Services Security Enhancement Release, effective November 09, 2020.

Quick Start using REST
Two of the most common uses of the D&B Direct API are locating a D&B D-U-N-S Number, and then obtaining a Detailed Company Profile for a company.

D&B Direct API calls must be made using Secured Socket Layers (SSL).

NOTE: To make either of these calls, you will need D&B Direct credentials. You can obtain sandbox (test environment) credentials by completing a online form.

Before making calls to any D&B Direct function using REST, you need to obtain an authentication token, which lasts for twenty four hours. Simply place your userid/password into the header and make the following POST call:

POST https://direct.dnb.com/Authentication/V2.0/
x-dnb-user: mubashir18@live.com
x-dnb-pwd: MyPassword

[BODY]
TransactionDetail: {
   "ApplicationTransactionID": "{user-defined}",
   "ServiceTransactionID": "{user-defined}",
   "TransactionTimestamp": "2001-12-17T09:30:47Z"
}
Copy the Authorization: value in the response, and include it in the header of subsequent calls. You'll also need to know what the latest version is for the respective service.
